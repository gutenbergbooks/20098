<h2><a name="WORRY" id="WORRY"></a>WORRY</h2>

<h3>The Nerve Racking Pace That
Causes "Americanitis"</h3>

<p>Nervous breakdowns are increasing as a
result of the American worry phobia.</p>

<p>This high tension Americanitis presumes
too much upon nature, by persistently
forcing the nerves to carry loads far beyond
their capacity.</p>

<p>So many people are pleasure mad, they
become so deadened by excess of enjoyment
and indulgence that ordinary pleasure is
uninteresting. They seek unnatural excitement,
original methods and unusual
activities to appease the appetite. Then
they become blas&eacute; and constitutional
pessimists.</p>

<p>It's a maddening, nerve racking pace
they go. To keep up the gait there is an
incessant battle for wealth, and the struggle
wears and weakens the nervous systems.</p>

<p>Both men and women go the terrific
gait. Men and women having this health-destroying
worry, mate and marry and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
lay foundations for deficient progeny that
suffers from the sins of the parents.</p>

<p>The phobia is almost universal; it has
permeated all classes of society from highest
to lowest.</p>

<p>Excitement, that's the keynote; for the
rich there is society and polo and useless
functions and conventions.</p>

<p>Society is a game of cards, not only playing
cards for money, but the card convention
of paying calls by leaving pasteboards
in lieu of the old-fashioned visit.</p>

<p>Society is the builder of fourflushers, the
generator of insincerity&mdash;falsehood and
rottenness.</p>

<p>For the poor, the aping of the rich, in
dress the wearers can ill afford, the picture
shows, the cheap theatres, the automobile,
bought with a mortgage on the home.</p>

<p>It's rush, push, excitement at any cost.
The great cost which they don't seem to
consider is the cost of the nerves.</p>

<p>We all enter the world with an abundance
of nerve energy, and by conserving that
energy we can adapt and adjust our nerve
equipment to keep pace with the progress
and evolution of our times.</p>

<p>The way to preserve and conserve nerve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
equilibrium and power is to rest and relax
the nerves each day.</p>

<p>You may rest them by a change of the
thought habit each day, by relaxation, by
sleep, and by suggestions made in this
book.</p>

<p>There are few advance danger signals
shown by the nervous systems, and in this
there is a marked difference between the
nerves and the organic system.</p>

<p>If you abuse your stomach, head, heart,
lungs, liver, kidneys or eyes, you have
distress and pain.</p>

<p>The nervous energy is like a barrel of
water; you can draw water from the faucet
at the bottom until you have almost exhausted
the contents.</p>

<p>Nature mends ordinary nerve waste each
day, like the rains replenish the cistern.</p>

<p>A reasonable use of your nerve force,
like a reasonable use of the rainwater,
means you can maintain a permanent
supply.</p>

<p>But you must be reasonable; you must
give the cistern a chance to refill and replace
that which you have drawn out.</p>

<p>You, who have shattered and tattered
your nerves, are not hopeless. You can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
come back, but it must be done by complete
change of the acts that brought on
the condition.</p>

<p>Get more sleep. Eliminate the useless,
harmful fads, fancies and functions, which
disturbed and prevented you from living a
sane, rational life.</p>

<p>Avoid extremes, cultivate rhythm and
regularity in your business and your home
life. Keep away from excitement. Read
really good books. Walk more, talk less.</p>

<p>Eat less heat-making foods and more
apples. Follow the diet, exercise and
thought rules suggested in "Pep."</p>

<p>Maybe these lines are being read by a
discouraged one who is "all nerves," which
means lost nerve force. To you I say there
is hope and cheer and strength and courage
if right here, now, you resolve to cut the
action, habits and stunts that knocked you
out and follow our suggestions.</p>

<p>I know, my friend, for I've trotted the
heat, danced the measure, and been through
the mill.</p>

<p>Now I am fearless, calm and prepared.
I can stand any calamity, meet any issue,
endure any sorrow.</p>

<p>I can do prodigious work in an emergency,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
go without rest or eating when required,
because I have Pep, which means poise,
efficiency&mdash;peace.</p>

<p>I realize nothing bad is as bad as it is
painted. Nothing is as good as its boosters
claim.</p>

<p>I go in the middle of the road, avoiding
extremes. I have confidence in my heart,
courage, hope, happiness, and content.</p>

<p>I've buried envy in a deep pit and covered
it with quick lime.</p>

<p>I am keeping worry out by keeping
faith, hope and cheer thoughts in my
brain room, and these are antiseptics
against the worry microbe.</p>

<p>I have my petty troubles and little make-believe
worries, just enough of them to
make me realize I have them licked, and
to remind me I must not let up on my
mastery of them.</p>

<p>Worry growls once in a while just to
make me grab tighter the handle of my
whip.</p>

<p>And you may enjoy this serene state,
too. There is no secret about it. I will
gladly give you the rules of the game in
this book. Just prepare to receive some
practical, helpful suggestions.</p>

<h2><a name="MAKING_PLANS" id="MAKING_PLANS"></a>MAKING PLANS</h2>

<h3>How to Use Our Assets to Best
Advantage</h3>


<p>You are a busy person, so am I. Busy
persons are the ones who do things. The
architect is a busy man, but he has learned
that the time spent in preparing his plans
is the most valuable employment of his
time. The plans enable him to do his work
systematically and lay down rules and
methods to get the highest efficiency and
accomplishment from those who do the
work of erecting the building.</p>

<p>If the architect would order lumber,
stone and hardware, without system, and
start to erect the building without carefully
prepared plans, the building would
lack symmetry and strength, and it would
be most expensive.</p>

<p>The planning time therefor was time
well spent.</p>

<p>Few persons have the ability to plan and
conserve their talents so as to produce the
highest efficiency. Men rush along thinking
their busyness means business. Really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
it means double energy and extra moves
to produce a given effect.</p>

<p>The elimination of unnecessary moves
means operating along lines of least resistance,
and any plan or method that will help
to do away with unnecessary moves and
make the necessary moves more potential
will be received with welcome, I am sure.</p>

<p>With the object of conserving energy and
strengthening your force, this book is
written.</p>

<p>It shall not be a book of ultimate definiteness
or a book of exact science. There is
no definite or exact rule that will apply,
without exceptions, to any science except
mathematics.</p>

<p>But we shall learn many helpful truths,
nevertheless, and if I err or disagree with
your conclusions, just eliminate those lines
and take the helps you find.</p>

<p>In my previous book, "Pep," I particularly
emphasized the importance of taking a few
minutes each evening and using the time
for sizing up things, by inventory, analysis,
speculation, comparison and hypothesis.</p>

<p>I have received many comments about
that particular suggestion.</p>

<p>I find that many of the great captains of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
industry who are accomplishing things
worth while, have learned the value of this
daily habit.</p>

<p>Mr. E. C. Simmons, the president of the
Simmons Hardware Company, has for about
fifty years followed this daily sizing up plan.
He takes fifteen to twenty minutes each
evening in seclusion, with closed eyes, and
finds the weaknesses of his plans, formulates
new plans, and generates new ideas for the
morrow. He says this habit is one of the
greatest contributing factors to his success
and to the building up of the largest hardware
business the world has ever known.</p>

<p>I want to help YOU to form the habit of
rounding up each day's activities in the
quiet, relaxed, uncolored, unprejudiced secluded
environment of your home. Each
evening we will together size up things&mdash;a
sort of daily round-up.</p>

<p>I have chosen the evening as the time
for our little talks. In the evening we can
be cozy, comfy and communicative. The
bank is closed. We met the note and got
through the day. We are alive and well;
we can open our hearts. There is no office
boy to disturb us, and the life insurance
agent is away at his club.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, we can be alone and tranquilly let
down the tension, lower the speed and with
normal heartbeats play the low tones, the
soft strains, the quieting music, and soothe
our nerves.</p>

<p>All day we've heard the band with its
drums and trombones and shrieky music.
The day with its busy whirl kept our
analyzing mental think-tank occupied with
thoughts of gain and game and fame.</p>

<p>In the evening we have time to study
logic and to reason, to analyze and inventory,
to thresh out problems.</p>

<p>So let us relax and reflect in these evening
round-ups.</p>

<h2><a name="NATURAL_LAW" id="NATURAL_LAW"></a>NATURAL LAW</h2>

<h3>Obedience Is Rewarded, Violation
Is Punished</h3>


<p>Man's nature makes it imperative for
him to be interested in something.</p>

<p>That interest is to his help or hurt,
according as he directs it.</p>

<p>There is much worry and misery in the
world because so many are astatic, like a
compass that has lost its loadstone.</p>

<p>Man is definitely the result of the
materials the body and the mind feed
upon.</p>

<p>Character is the result of a determined
purpose to be and to do right, to one's self
and to his fellows.</p>

<p>The man of character focuses his attention
on truth, and on fact.</p>

<p>He uses theories with fact, to aid his
progress, but he recognizes that theories,
without fact as a safety ballast, is a useless
expenditure.</p>

<p>Theories without fact leaves man in a
rudderless boat; he gets nowhere, he only
drifts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Theories often help to get at facts, but
the better way is to get at fact by proven
experience, of which there is an <ins class="mycorr" title="printed
text 'inexhaustable'">inexhaustible</ins>
abundance in the world.</p>

<p>Facts are based on natural laws. The
study of natural laws is beneficial.</p>

<p>We shall strive in our studies to keep
close to fact with just enough speculation
to enliven the interest in facts.</p>

<p>Living the artificial life makes for worry,
illness and failure.</p>

<p>Living in harmony with the great natural
laws is the helpful way to live.</p>

<p>To abide by the law is safety, to violate
the law brings punishment.</p>

<p>Every man is better if he follows scientific
methods and habits of thought and living.</p>

<p>The loafing or astatic mind will fall into
morbid tendencies.</p>

<p>The employed, truth-seeking, idealistic,
hopeful mind is never dependent on people
or things for its pleasure.</p>

<p>The acquiring of helpful knowledge, the
seeking of worth-while truth, are ever
profitable employments, paying present and
future dividends, and meanwhile those
acts positively divert the thought from
morbid tendencies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>The Evening Round-Up is intended to be
a companionable, helpful text book, a
counselor and a friend.</p>

<p>We shall strive to bring helpful knowledge,
good cheer and interesting facts, for
your present occupation and benefit.</p>

<p>If I succeed in accomplishing my purpose
even in part my time has been well spent.</p>

<p>We have an unchallenged fact to rest
our feet on, a fact that shall follow us
through all the pages of this book; and
that is: our thoughts NEVER stop, our
brains never sleep.</p>

<p>While we live we shall never get away
from our thought; so then, we must consider
that thought current, and reckon
with it.</p>

<p>The motive power is turned on and we
must grasp the helm if we sail the sea of
life successfully, baffling storms and avoiding
rocks.</p>

<p>Scientific books are usually dry, uninviting
reading; they lack the human interest.
They are generally bloodless skeletons.</p>

<p>We shall try to weave science into new
patterns and paint interesting pictures so
that science will attract and not repel.</p>

<p>This book is different in its suggestions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
in its prescriptions, in its language, but it
is universal with all scientific books, in that
its aim is helpful truth.</p>

<p>We go by different routes, but our objective
point is the same.</p>

<p>We will avoid technical names and symbols
and speak the common language that
the multitude understands.</p>

<p>We shall deal with problems and aspirations
that come to us all in this busy
workaday world.</p>

<p>We shall try to cut the underbrush in
the swamp and blaze a plain trail out on to
the big high road.</p>

<p>We shall keep in step to the drum-beats
of truth, we will rest and recreate in cool
shady places, and then up and on to our
purpose with smiles on our faces, courage
in our hearts, and song on our lips.</p>

<p>Every moment of our journey shall be
worth while and positively helpful if we
take the trip with conscientious applications,
and continuity of purpose.</p>

<p>Our path is strewn with roses and thorns;
we must enjoy the roses and escape the
thorns.</p>

<p>We welcome you, the neophyte, who has
joined us in our pilgrimage.</p>

<h2><a name="PERSONAL" id="PERSONAL"></a>PERSONAL</h2>
<h3>Are YOU Pleasant to Live With?</h3>


<p>Let's be personal; that's a good way to
establish a good idea in place of a bad one.</p>

<p>Are YOU pleasant to live with? Keep
this personal question before you, even if
you are cocksure that you can answer, yes.</p>

<p>Maybe there are some little jars, rattles,
gratings, you are not aware of. Few of us
are honest when looking for our own faults.
There may be some sand in your gear box.
It won't hurt you to keep the personal
question alive for a few days,&mdash;"Am I
pleasant to live with?"</p>

<p>I love the pleasant people whether they
are fat, lean, tall, short, red heads, brown
heads, homely, handsome, republicans or
democrats.</p>

<p>The complaining, unpleasant grouch is
like a bear with a toothache, miserable
himself and spreading misery all around.</p>

<p>A freckle-faced, red-headed, cross-eyed
man with a healthy funny bone will spread
more cheerfulness and sunshine than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
bench full of sad and solemn justices of the
supreme court, or a religious conference.</p>

<p>What a different story would be written
of Job, if he had only possessed a servant
who could dance a double shuffle and
whistle "Dixie" while cooking breakfast.</p>

<p>David was a man after my own heart;
he brought gladsome songs into the world.
He, said "Live the ways of pleasantness."</p>

<p>You can pray, sing, play, work, think,
rest, hope, you can be well or ill, rich or
poor and still be pleasant to live with.</p>

<p>Being pleasant helps you to be strong in
body and mind, and it keeps you young a
long time. It's good medicine, I know it.
My little motto, "Be pleasant every morning
until ten o'clock, the rest of the day
will take care of itself," has brought sunshine
into many homes.</p>

<p>If you frown it will soon get to be a
habit&mdash;and give you a heavy heart. If you
smile your face will be attractive, no matter
how unlucky you were in the lottery of
beauty.</p>

<p>Be pleasant and you will never feel old.</p>

<p>Every girl wants to catch a husband.
Remember this, girls: A pleasant disposi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>tion is more benefit than seven barrels of
beauty cream.</p>

<p>The pleasant disposition is a sure route
to happy land and happy homes.</p>

<p>Old Ponce de Leon lost out in searching
for the fountain of youth. If he had been
pleasant he would have kept the smiles on
his wife's face and there would have been
no excuse to leave her to find the mythical
fountain.</p>

<p>Hoe cake, bacon and smiles beat lobster,
champagne and frowns.</p>

<p>Our land is thrice blessed with its peaceful,
happy homes&mdash;for "happy homes are
the strength of a nation."</p>

<p>Be pleasant in your home, make the
children feel home is the pleasantest place
in the world.</p>

<p>Every act and example is written in the
child's memory tablet. Let your hours with
the children be loving, laughing, living hours.</p>

<p>Pat them on the head, joke with them,
whisper affection, express love to them.
Those acts will be remembered in all their
years to come, for you are planting everlasting
plants that may pass onto a hundred
generations and make children happy a
thousand years from now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Be pleasant to live with and the people
will turn to you as you pass and shine your
cheerfulness like the sunflowers turn to face
the sun.</p>

<p>Be pleasant to live with and you will
have more pleasant things to live for, and
there will be kindnesses, kisses, beauty,
health, peace, fun, happiness and content
coming your way all along the great big
road of life you are traveling.</p>

<p>Be pleasant, don't be cross and crabbed
because someone else in the household is
not pleasant. Do your part; you will likely
thereby cure the frown habit on the face
of the unfortunate disturber of your peace.</p>

<p>Make yourself right before you criticize
your life partner. Answer this question,
"Am I pleasant to live with?"</p>

<p>Don't fool yourself in the matter. Get
right down to brass tacks with yourself,
watch your moves and acts and attitude
for ten days carefully before answering the
question.</p>

<p>If your answer is no, then now is your
time to change your attitude and try the
pleasant plan, and here is my blessing and
good wishes in such an event.</p>

<h2><a name="PRACTICAL_HELPS" id="PRACTICAL_HELPS"></a>PRACTICAL HELPS</h2>

<h3>Dealing With Actual Conditions
You Are Facing</h3>


<p>I have been fortunate in having splendid
eye-sight and hearing, and with these, a
good memory.</p>

<p>I've traveled much and my education
has been getting experience directly or
learning experience directly from those who
had experience.</p>

<p>All the while I've had to do with, and
about business and social problems, and
with and about the things which worry
and perplex the man or woman in the business
as well as the home world.</p>

<p>I am trying to stage this book, and our
relationship, upon practical things we are
to talk about. I want you to know and
feel I have hoped and feared even as you
have.</p>

<p>I am in the midst of these things even
now as I write this book. I am not in a
reflective mood, living in the past or glorying
in deeds of other days. I am writing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
this today and of today, even as you are
reading it today.</p>

<p>By day I face reality and problems, and
temptations and tricks and frauds and
deceits, and after the day is over I write
these lines and try to inoculate myself
with a serum or toxin that will serve as a
safeguard on the morrow to ward off the
things which try to annoy and distract me
from my purpose: to do, and to be, as nearly
right and fair as I can, in act and thought
and word.</p>

<p>Continuity on a singleness of purpose is
a valuable thing. Fabre spent his life
studying insect life. His books on the
spider and others on the life of insects are
the result of a whole life spent on the one
hobby or study of insects.</p>

<p>My occupation has been full of abrupt
changes. Each day is a kaleidoscope, and
so, as I write between times, these chapters
may be like the boy who said of the dictionary,
"a mighty powerful book but the
subject changes so often."</p>

<p>I write these chapters as the spirit moves
and opportunity allows, and you may read
the same way. But be sure you make
opportunity happen often.</p>

<h2><a name="OBSERVATION" id="OBSERVATION"></a>OBSERVATION</h2>

<h3>Sitting on the Side Lines, Watching
the Crowd</h3>


<p>There is fun and interest and diversion
all around us. All we need is keen observation
and we will see much that passes unnoticed
to the preoccupied person.</p>

<p>What an interesting thing is the great
round world we live in. The people are as
interesting as fish in an aquarium.</p>

<p>See the rushing, surging crowd. Man,
pushing along searching for necessary things
to be done, he builds cities, harnesses rivers,
makes ships to sail the seas to the uttermost
parts of the earth. Man goes to war,
he builds death-dealing devices.</p>

<p>Man makes the desert blossom like a
rose.</p>

<p>Here is the scientist in his laboratory,
trying to unite certain elements to produce
new substance. Here is the beauty in her
silken nest; here the lover; there the musician;
yonder the peanut man and in the
office building is the captain of industry:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
All busy bees deeply absorbed in their
respective interests, and intoxicated in the
belief that they are important and greatly
necessary.</p>

<p>Yet in the broad measure of ages they
are mere ripples on the sea of time, faint
bubbles on the eternal deep, and grains of
sand at the mountain foot.</p>

<p>Great man by his own measure, minute
man by the great measure of time. Mammoths
to the near-sighted, mites to the far-sighted.
Hustle and bustle, crowd and
push. They tramp down the weaker
brothers in the mad race after the golden
shekels, which are only measures of ability
to buy and own material things; symbols of
power to make others serve you. These
golden shekels which men fret, sweat and
fight for, can only buy physical and material
things.</p>

<p>Away from the crowd is the little group
who have learned a great truth, which is,
happiness is not to be bought with gold.
This little minority knows that mental
pleasures are best, and that mental pleasures
cannot be found on the great highway of
material conquest.</p>

<p>The puffy, corn-fed millionaire pities the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
man who is content to live with small means
and enjoys what he has to the full extent.</p>

<p>The wise man is he who gets the fullness
out of life, happiness, respect, content,
freedom from worry, who is busy doing
useful things, busy helping his brother,
busy training his children, busy spreading
sunshine and love and the close-together
feeling in his home circle.</p>

<p>The corn-fed, hardened, senseless, money-mad,
dollar-worshipper knows not peace.
Smiles seldom linger on his lips. Peace
never rests in his bosom, cheer never lights
his face. He is simply a fighting machine,
miserable in solitude, suffering when inactive
and sick when resting.</p>

<p>The money-chaser is up and doing, working
like a Trojan, because occupation takes
his mind off the painful picture of his misspent
opportunity and his destroyed natural
instinct. When fighting for gold he forgets
his appalling poverty of the really worth-while
things in the world.</p>

<p>Like the drunkard in his cups the intoxication
makes him forget, and he is negatively
happy.</p>

<p>Money received as reward for doing
things worth while is laudable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot sit idly by and neglect to
earn money to provide food, shelter and
education for our loved ones, but between
times we should seek the wealth that comes
from right mental employment.</p>

<p>The millionaire thinks, dreams and gets
dollars and that is all.</p>

<p>The worth-while man thinks kindness,
usefulness, self-improvement, brotherhood,
love, and he gets happiness.</p>

<p>The man who discovers means to help
his fellowman, does a good act, but it is the
man with the dollars in front of his eyes
that commercializes the discovery and invention.</p>

<p>In the end the man that helped mankind
fares better than the man who made the
millions.</p>

<p>It's a great crowd surging by, and very
few have the good sense to learn the value
of TODAY. That great crowd I see below
my window thinks ever of tomorrow and
forgets TODAY.</p>

<p>Those who think always of tomorrow
will never get the beauties and joys from
life that comes to the little group, of Today,
who appreciates and enjoys the real Now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
rather than the pictured Tomorrow that
never comes.</p>

<p>It's mighty interesting to watch the
crowd go by and speculate on their movements.</p>

<p>Save up your pennies, measure everything
by the dollar standard, think dollars,
dream dollars, work, slave, push for the
dollars and you will build a fortune. You
will never have peace or recreation, or joy;
you will live only in hope of a some day
when you will retire. That's the way the
millionaires travel life's highway.</p>

<p>Some day the paper will announce the
death of those millionaires and then the
dollars will be blown in by reckless heirs,
and so the grinding wheels roll on.</p>

<p>Surely there are many ways of looking
at things. Surely there is much of interest
in the crowd. Surely there is an unending
fund from which to speculate, in that
crowd way down on the street below my
window.</p>

<p>What passions, what hopes, what joys,
what sorrows, are in the hearts of that
hurrying, worrying crowd.</p>

<p>What noise this din of traffic makes,
what activity man has stirred up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>A picture, a drama, a tragedy, a comedy,
all these I see in the human ants that run
along below the hive where I sit and write
these lines.</p>

<p>The phone rings and my little Nancy
Lou's voice says, "Daddy, will you please
bring me a pencil and a tablet with lines
on it."</p>

<p>So I must needs stop this, whatever you
may call it, and push through the crowd to
get that tablet with "lines on it" for my
Nancy Lou; and there is some feeling of
happiness and content and peace in Daddy's
heart as he lays down his pen, for Daddy
is going Home, and that word means a lot
in his little family, where they all say
"Daddy" instead of Papa or Father.</p>

<h2><a name="DOING_THINGS_TWICE" id="DOING_THINGS_TWICE"></a>DOING THINGS TWICE</h2>

<h3>A Common Habit That Saps Nerve
Power</h3>


<p>It is hard enough to do duty once, but
doubly hard when you anticipate mentally
everything you have to do tomorrow.</p>

<p>This doing things twice is a habit easily
acquired if you don't watch out, and it
means wasted energy.</p>

<p>I have just read the experience of a housewife
who was resting on a couch reading;
her eye caught sight of a book lying on the
floor across the room.</p>

<p>Instantly her mindometer, if I may coin
a word, registered, "when you get up, pick
up that book."</p>

<p>She went on reading, but her mind was
not on the magazine she held, but on that
book on the floor.</p>

<p>So obsessed did she become that she was
miserable until she got up and picked up
the book.</p>

<p>I was talking with a woman who was
resting on her porch; her day's work was
over. She was dressed for the afternoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Everything in the home was neat, sweet,
clean and tidy. All serene but her face,
and that was the window through which
I saw worry working overtime.</p>

<p>By strategy I learned the trouble, and
here is her story: "Tomorrow a lot of
fruit will be ready to preserve. I am worrying
where I shall put it. My fruit closet
is full."</p>

<p>The woman had every reason to say to
herself "sufficient unto the day," yet she
was doing the preserving mentally today
and tomorrow she would do the work
physically.</p>

<p>A tired mind is harder to rest than a
tired body, so we must nip this advance
mental work in the bud.</p>

<p>We have all had mental obsessions of
worrying about the things we were going
to take on our trip; then worrying over the
routine of our work when we return from
our trip.</p>

<p>If the housewife looks over her week's
work and washes the dishes, makes the
beds, cooks the meals, dresses the children,
mends the clothes, in her imagination, before
she does them in reality, she is indeed
a hard working woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>It's all right to plan your work; that's
economy in mental expenditure, for it simplifies,
systematizes, and saves work.</p>

<p>Plan your work in advance, but do not
keep your mind on the plans until the
work is done.</p>

<p>When you have planned, then close the
mental book of tomorrow's duty, and turn
to pleasures, rest, relaxation and enjoyment
of today.</p>

<p>These little round-ups we have each
evening are fine to switch the thought current
from tomorrow's duties.</p>

<p>It is to get a definite, different thought
habit fixed, that I ask you to give me these
few minutes each day when we may consider
various phases of life, science, pleasure,
morals and mental refreshment.</p>

<p>True we can only have a fleeting look at
things, but we'll get enough, I hope, to
freshen your minds, change the humdrum,
and elicit interest in things.</p>

<p>Maybe these round-ups we have will
help us, and keep us from working mentally
tomorrow's physical work.</p>

<p>If these evening talks interest you, help
clear your vision, help cheer you, help rest
you, then they are good for you, and be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
cause they help you they certainly benefit
me and make me very happy, because
happiness comes from doing something for
others.</p>

<p>I write as the mood strikes me, or as a
phase of life comes before me, or as an
idea strikes in and just won't let go until
I grasp my pen and let the words flow.</p>

<p>I mean this book is human, and not a
studied literary effort.</p>

<p>Just get the human viewpoint and don't
criticize the words used or the sentences I
construct.</p>

<p>I want to reach you right there alone in
the room where you are reading this, and
I want the suggestions, the good, the help,
to soak in and I want you to pass the good
you get to your brother; you won't lose a
bit by so doing.</p>

<h2><a name="NERVES" id="NERVES"></a>NERVES</h2>

<h3>The Doctors' Most Difficult
Problem</h3>


<p>"She is all right&mdash;her only trouble is her
NERVES." How often we hear that and
how little does the person with steady
nerves appreciate the tortures of "nerves."</p>

<p>A cut, a bruise, a headache, or any of
the physical ailments can be quickly cured.
Nature will mend the break, but tired,
worn, stretched, abused nerves take time to
restore. These nerve ailments call for most
vigorous mental treatment.</p>

<p>Neurasthenia means debilitated or prostrated
nerves and it shows itself first of all
by worry. Worry means the inability to
relax the attention from a definite fear or
fancied hard luck. Worry leads to many
physical and mental disorders.</p>

<p>Left alone this worry stage develops into
an acute state and brings with it nervous
prostration, and sometimes a complete
collapse of the will power.</p>

<p>Before the acute stage of neurasthenia
is reached there is noticed "brain fag,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and brain fag is nature's warning signal
calling upon you to take notice and change
your mental habits.</p>

<p>Worry sometimes develops into hysteria;
again it takes the form of hypochondria or
chronic blues. The hypochondriac has a
chronic, morbid anxiety about personal
health and personal welfare. Frequently
this state is accompanied by melancholia.</p>

<p>Melancholia is the forks in the roads.
One road leads to incurable insanity, the
other to curable melancholia. Right here
is where heroic action is needed by the
sufferer.</p>

<p>Here is where the sufferer must exert his
will power, change completely his mental
and physical habits and his surroundings.
Occupation, changed habits, taking in of
confidence, faith and courage thoughts&mdash;these
changes are necessary to the victim
of melancholia, or he will shatter on the
danger rocks and go to pieces.</p>

<p>Melancholia is where is offered a good
chance for Christian Science. Mental suggestion,
powerful personality of a friend,
and the personal help such a friend can
give by counsel, example and suggestion,
are all helps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>I have abundant evidence that melancholia
sufferers can be restored to peace,
efficiency and poise, by proper thought direction,
and by proper physical employment.</p>

<p>"Pep," which has principally to do with
mental efficiency, definitely lays down rules
and practical suggestions for the employment
of the mind and body. I have letters
and verbal proofs in quantity proving the
efficiency of those rules and suggestions.</p>

<p>So wonderful have been the results, so
numerous the recoveries, that the testimonials,
if published, would make the fake
nerve tonic manufacturer die of envy.</p>

<p>"Only your nerves." I cannot understand
why the word, only, is used. It
makes it appear that nerves are of minor
importance.</p>

<p>Nerves are less understood than anything
in the human anatomy.</p>

<p>Experience has proved that nerves cannot
be restored by dope, patent medicines,
tonics or prescriptions.</p>

<p>The cure must come by and through the
individual possessing the nerves and by
and through the individual's power of will
and mastery of the mind.</p>

<p>Get the mental equipment right. Let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the mind master the body. Let the nerve
sufferer get hold of himself and fill his brain
with faith thought instead of fear thought,
with courage instead of cowardice, with
strength instead of weakness, with hope
instead of despair, with smiles instead of
frowns, with occupation instead of sluggishness,
and wonders will appear.</p>

<p>The little shredded, tingling nerve ends
will then commence to synchronize instead
of fight, to harmonize instead of discord,
to build instead of destroy.</p>

<p>The building, or coming back to a normal
state, is slow; it takes time, patience and
will power, but it can be done. I know.
I have been through the mill, and I pass
the word to you and try to stir you to be
up and doing, even as I did.</p>

<p>Your nerves can be steadied, your
thoughts uplifted, your health restored,
your ambition re-established, your normality
fixed.</p>

<p>Smiles, love and content are to be yours.
Poise, efficiency, peace, your blessings.
Health, happiness and hope your dividends.
All these I promise you if you will read
carefully this book from cover to cover
and follow its plain, practical teachings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The curriculum is not hard, it is not my
discovery. I am merely the purveyor of
facts, the gleaner of truth, and the selector
of helpful experiences, first of all for my
own benefit and having proved the truth
in my own case and by friends to whom I
passed the truths and rules.</p>

<p>I made bold to write books, but the
writing has paid me well, not alone in
dollars, but from having done a helpful
thing in writing for other humans who
have had problems, worries and nerves.</p>

<p>The big books on nerves are discouraging
and forbidding by their immensity and
labyrinth of scientific technical terms. They
are fine for teachers, but discouraging for
the layman.</p>

<p>The great everyday crowd is the class I
want to talk to and so I endeavor to write
in plain human, sincere style from heart to

<h2><a name="PESSIMISTS" id="PESSIMISTS"></a>PESSIMISTS</h2>

<h3>Give Them the Cold Shoulder</h3>


<p>The calamity howler is found in the
midst of peace and plenty. This pessimist
sows seeds of discord, plants envy, generates
the anarchist spirit, and is an all-around
nuisance.</p>

<p>A man may spend years erecting a
building; a fiend can demolish it in a
minute with a stick of dynamite.</p>

<p>The calamity howler is a destroyer; he
doesn't think, he spurts out words. His
words and arguments are simply parrot
mimicry and void of intellectual impulse, as
are the movements of an angle worm.</p>

<p>These peace destroyers talk of their
rights and they expect and demand the
same privileges and benefits that are earned
by the man who uses his head.</p>

<p>These ghouls are born without heads;
they just have necks that grow up and are
covered with hair. These brainless mollusks
are now telling the people that the
Sultan of Sulu is to capture Texas and that
Japan is to invade Indianapolis; Germany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is to capture Quebec, and France is to
siege Milwaukee.</p>

<p>The howlers spread talk of yellow peril
and black plague to follow. They spread
doubt and fear; they tell you the capitalists
are awake nights trying to starve you and
that they employ inventors to discover new
methods of torture for the poor working
man.</p>

<p>They accuse business men of grinding
down the farmer, forming pools, establishing
starvation prices, and ruining agriculture.
Yet, as I write these lines, fat
beef cattle sell for $10.00 a hundred on
the hoof, wheat is way over $1.00 a bushel,
and good farms in Missouri even are selling
at from $100.00 to $150.00 per acre.</p>

<p>Good farm mortgages are hard to get.
The farmers have money in the banks,
honey in the house, and automobiles in the
garage.</p>

<p>Our taxes in the United States are lower
than anywhere on the face of the earth.
Our wages are higher than anywhere in the
world. Our schools better, our opportunities
greater.</p>

<p>And in the midst of better conditions
and brighter prospects the shameless, brain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>less,
fameless bipeds pollute the atmosphere,
poison hearts and plant discontent.</p>

<p>If these howlers are any better than foot-pads,
thieves, grave robbers, or child
beaters, I can't see it.</p>

<p>And it is up to you and to me to denounce
these peace destroyers, ridicule
them, show our contempt for them; they
have no hearts, no souls, they are only
decay spots that spread rottenness, disease,
despair, discouragement, contamination and
anarchy, and we do not want such guests
at our quilting parties or husking bees.</p>

<h2><a name="GLOOM_CONTAGION" id="GLOOM_CONTAGION"></a>GLOOM CONTAGION</h2>

<h3>A Little Study of Faces in a Street
Car</h3>


<p>This evening I rode home in a crowded
street car. What an interesting study to
watch the faces in that car.</p>

<p>Discontent, discomfort, worry, gloominess
on nearly every face. Tired faces,
tired bodies from a hard day's work,
mouth corners drooped. Hopelessness
stamped on the countenances.</p>

<p>As the people came in the car some of
them had smiles or at least passable expressions,
but when they got crowded together
and saw the gloomy faces the gloom spread
to their faces, too.</p>

<p>At a picnic all are smiling and laughing.
In the street car at six o'clock the long
procession of workers is a stream of solemn
faces. Contagion, example, surrounding,
yes, that's it&mdash;contagion and example.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the cars all is gloom,
blueness and sorrow faces. At eight o'clock
many of these faces will be changed; there
will be joy, smiles, rosiness, singing and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
dancing. Yet the actual conditions of
finance, health, hope or prospects haven't
changed since these people were in the car
at six o'clock.</p>

<p>Why then such a change in two hours?</p>

<p>It is this: at seven o'clock these workers
sat down to supper, they were out of that
gloom-reflected street car atmosphere. Now
they are talking, they are rounding-up the
day's activities; they are HOME with
mother, sister, brother and the kiddies.
The home ones greet them with smiles, the
appetizing supper pleases the palate, good
cheer permeates, and all is smiles and joy.</p>

<p>Gloom spreads gloom. Joy spreads joy.
Gloom is black; joy is white. One darkens,
the other brightens.</p>

<p>Well, then, where's the moral? What's
the benefit from this little study of the
street car passengers?</p>

<p>The lesson is plain: it is that you and I
are ferments of joy or acids of gloom. We
are influences to help or to hurt. To hurt
others by our example hurts us. To help
others by our example helps us. We become
happier than ever.</p>

<p>In the street car life was not worth living
if you judged by the pained faces. In two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
hours by changed thought the example of
life was worth while.</p>

<p>What changes the mental attitude makes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When a man has spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His very last cent&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world looks blue, you bet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But give him a dollar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loud he will holler<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's life in the old world yet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Next time we get on the street car let's
plant some smiles. Let's give that lady a
seat and smile when we do it.</p>

<p>We can spread cheer by merely wearing
a cheery face. Costs little, pays big.
Let's do it.</p>

<h2><a name="HAPPINESS" id="HAPPINESS"></a>HAPPINESS</h2>

<h3>Hovers Near Us If We Do Not
Chase It</h3>


<p>Some of our richest blessings are gained
by not striving for them directly. This is
so true that we accept the blessings without
thinking about how we came to get them.</p>

<p>Particularly true is this in the matter of
happiness. Everyone wants to be happy,
but few know how to secure this blessing.</p>

<p>Most people have the idea that the possession
of material things is necessary to
happiness and that idea is what keeps
architects, automobile makers, jewelers,
tailors, hotels, railroads, steamships and
golf courses busy.</p>

<p>Do your duty well, have a worth-while
ambition, be a dreamer, have an ideal.
Keep your duty in mind, be occupied
sincerely with your work, keep on the road
to your ideal and happiness will cross your
path all the while.</p>

<p>Happiness is an elusive prize; it's wary,
timid, alert and cannot be caught. Chase
it and it escapes your grasp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>I read today of a friend who walked
home with a workman. This is the workman's
story: He had a son who was making
a record in school. He had two daughters
who helped their mother; he had a
cottage, a little yard, a few flowers, a
garden. He worked hard in a garage by
day and evenings he cultivated his flowers,
his garden, and his family. He had health,
plus contentment a-plenty. His possessions
were few and the care of them consequently
a negligible effort.</p>

<p>Happiness flowed in the cracks of his
door. Smiles were on his lips, joy in his
heart, love in his bosom; that's the story
my friend heard.</p>

<p>Then came a friend in an automobile on
his way home from the club. He picked
up my friend and to him a tale of woe,
misery and discontent did unfold.</p>

<p>This club man had money, automobiles,
social standing, possessions, and all the
objects and material things envious persons
covet&mdash;yet he was unhappy. His whole
life was spent chasing happiness, but his
sixty horsepower auto wasn't fast enough
to catch it.</p>

<p>The poor man I have told you about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was the man who washed the club man's
auto.</p>

<p>The strenuous pleasure seeker fails to get
happiness; that is an inexorable law. He
develops into a pessimist with an acrid,
satirical disgust at all the simple, worth-while,
real things in life.</p>

<p>This is not a new discovery of mine; it's
an old truth. Read Ecclesiastes, the pessimistic
chronicle of the Bible, and you'll find
what comes to the pleasure-chaser, and you
will know about "vanity and vexation of
spirit."</p>

<p>Do something for somebody. Engage in
moves and enterprises that will be a service
to the community and help the uplift of
mankind. This making others happy is a
positive insurance and guarantee of your
own happiness.</p>

<p>You must keep a stiff upper lip, a stiff
backbone; you must forget the wishbone
and the envious heart.</p>

<p>Paul had trials, setbacks, hardships and
hard labors; he had defeats and discouragements
and still the record shows he was
"always rejoicing."</p>

<p>Paul was a man of Pep. In the dungeon
with his feet in stocks he sang songs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
rejoiced. Paul was happy, ever and always,
not because he strove to get happiness, but
because he had dedicated his life to a service
to mankind.</p>

<p>The real hero, the real man of fame, the
real man of popularity, doesn't arrive
through direct quest, for any of these
things; the result is incidental.</p>

<p>The real hero forgets self first of all; that
is the essential step to greatness.</p>

<p>Washington at Valley Forge had no
thought that his acts there would furnish
inspiration for a picture that would endure
for generations.</p>

<p>Lincoln, the care-worn, tired noble man,
in his speech at Gettysburg, never dreamed
that speech would stamp him as a master
of words and thought, in the hearts of his
countrymen. He thought not of self. He
was trying to soothe wounds, cheer troubled
spirits, and give courage to those who had
been so long in shadowland.</p>

<p>Ever has it been that fame, glory, happiness
are rewards, given not to those who
strive to capture, but to those who strive
to free others from their troubles, burdens
and problems.</p>

<h2><a name="THOUGHT_CONTROL" id="THOUGHT_CONTROL"></a>THOUGHT CONTROL</h2>

<h3>"As a Man Thinketh in His Heart
so is He"</h3>


<p>A little child is crying over a real or
fancied injury to her body or to her pride.</p>

<p>So long as she keeps her mind on the
subject she is miserable.</p>

<p>Distract her attention, get her mind on
another subject, and her tears stop and
smiles replace frowns.</p>

<p>This shows how we are creatures of our
thoughts. "As a man thinketh in his
heart, so is he" is a truth that has endured
through the centuries.</p>

<p>We are children in so far as we cry and
suffer when we think of our ills or hurts or
wrongs or bad luck.</p>

<p>We can smile and have peace, poise and
strength if we change our thoughts to faith,
courage and confidence.</p>

<p>Our condition is what we make it. If we
think fear, worry and misery, we will
suffer. If we think faith, peace and happiness,
we will enjoy life.</p>

<p>Every thought that comes out of our
brain had to go in first.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>If we feed our brain storehouse with
trash and fear, and nonsense, we have a
poor material to draw from.</p>

<p>The last thought we put in the brain
before going to sleep is most likely to last
longest. So it is our duty to quietly relax,
to slow down&mdash;to eliminate fear-thought,
self-accusation, and to substitute some good
helpful thought in closing the mental book
of each day.</p>

<p>Therefore read a chapter or two from a
worth-while book the last thing before
going to bed.</p>

<p>Say to yourself, "I am unafraid; I can,
I will awake in the morning with smiles on
my face, courage in my heart, and song on
my lips."</p>

<p>These suggestions for closing the day
will be of instant help to you.</p>

<p>The great power for good, the wherewith
to give you strength, progress and
efficiency is within yourself and at the
command of your will.</p>

<p>You can't think faith and fear, good and
bad, courage and defeat, all at the same
time.</p>

<p>You can only think one thing at a time.</p>

<p>Your great power is your will, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
wherewith to help yourself is your thought
habit.</p>

<p>Change your thought habit as you go
to bed. You can do it; it's a matter of will
determination. The more faithful you are
to your purpose, the easier your task will
be. Be patient, conscientious rational and
confident.</p>

<p>You are what your thoughts picture you
to be. Your will directs your thoughts.</p>

<p>Don't get discouraged if you can't suddenly
change your life from shadow to sunshine,
from illness to wellness.</p>

<p>Big things take time and patience. The
great ship lies in the harbor pointed North.
A tug boat could make a sudden pull and
break the great chain or tow line.</p>

<p>Yet you could take a half-inch rope and
with your own hands turn the great ship
completely around by pulling steadily and
patiently. The movement would be slow,
but it would be sure and you would finally
accomplish your purpose.</p>

<p>Don't jerk and fret and be impatient with
yourself. You have been for years perhaps
worrying and thinking fear-thoughts. You
have put a lot of useless and harmful
material in your brain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>You can't clean all your brain house in a
day or a week, but you can do a little
cleaning each day.</p>

<p>You can take the faith rope of good
purpose and start to pull gently, and
finally you will turn your whole life's
character toward the port of success.</p>

<p>If you have read "Pep" and followed its
rules, you are now in a state of poise,
efficiency and peace, and realize the truths
of this chapter, for you learned in detail
the rules for your daily conduct, practice,
and how to apply suggestions.</p>

<p>The great crowd worries; only the few
have learned the power of the will, and the
benefits to be derived from mental control.</p>

<p>Business and social duties call for strong
men and women. You can't reach mastership
if you remain a slave.</p>

<p>Your first duty is to yourself, and success
or failure is your reward exactly in proportion
as you exercise your will power and
handle your thought habits.</p>

<h2><a name="MEDICINE" id="MEDICINE"></a>MEDICINE</h2>

<h3>Proofs That Mind Control is the
Best Medicine</h3>


<p>The doctors are giving less medicine and
doing more in the way of suggesting diet,
and exercise rules, sanitation and preventive
practices.</p>

<p>Medicine is mostly poison and its effect
is to shock the organs or glands to bring
about reaction. Nature makes the cure.</p>

<p>In emergency drugs are all right, but the
doctor and not the individual should settle
the matter of what drug to use and the
time to use it.</p>

<p>When there's a pain or disease it's due
to congestion of some organ, to infection,
or to improper nourishment or improper
habits.</p>

<p>Ninety per cent of the aches, pains or
ailments can be cured by a dominant
mental attitude and attention to eating and
exercise.</p>

<p>The habitual medicine user is not cured
by the medicine but by nature; the medicine
simply serves as a means to establish <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span><ins class="mycorr"
title="printed book has 'ment' and '-tal' either side of the page break">mental</ins>
control and confidence that the sufferer
is to get well.</p>

<p>Recently I have spent much time in a
large hospital visiting a relative who had
been operated on. I know several of the
staff of doctors and nurses.</p>

<p>I have seen many operations, some very
heroic ones, and my appreciation of the
good work of good surgeons is greatly
augmented by the wonderful helps I have
seen them bring to suffering humanity.
I have talked with and watched the cases
of scores of patients.</p>

<p>I have by plausible logic, mental suggestion,
and good cheer to the hospital
patients, brought many a smile through a
mist of tears.</p>

<p>I have seen wonderful results of mental
suggestion to the discouraged patients.</p>

<p>To show the effects faith thought will
produce, I will relate some instances.</p>

<p>One patient screaming for a hypodermic
injection to relieve her pain was given an
injection of sterilized water and the pain
vanished.</p>

<p>Another just could not sleep without her
bromide. The nurse fixed up a powder of
sugar, salt and flour, the patient took the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
powder and went to sleep. That was mind
control and mental longing satisfied.</p>

<p>Another patient had to take something
to stop her pains; she got capsules of
magnesia. The capsule satisfied her longing,
established her faith and gave her
relief; the relief was through her mind and
not by the capsule.</p>

<p>I have seen several weary, despondent
patients fretting and wearing themselves
out over their so-called weakness and condition.
I have placed copies of "Pep" in
their hands and watched courage, faith,
cheer and sereneness come to them.</p>

<p>The reading of "Pep" diverted their
minds from self-thought and self-accusation
to faith-thought and courage.</p>

<p>"Pep" is simply powerful common-sense,
practical, digestible, hope, faith, cheer and
courage. One brain cannot at the same
time hold its attention on faith and fear,
on joy or sorrow, on smiles and tears.</p>

<p>You can only think one thing at a time,
and "Pep" or any other book that can
change the habit thought from fear to faith,
from worry to peace, is doing a service.</p>

<p>I've been in shadowland in the hospital
to see for myself the actual help that mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
control will bring to sufferers and the
evidence is far above my powers to describe.</p>

<p>I'm mighty glad I wrote "Pep" for it
has helped many a brother and sister out
of darkness into sunshine, and proved the
value of right thinking and mental control.</p>

<p>I've seen the lifting up of a patient's
hope, when the cheery surgeon came with
hope, smiles and confidence on his face.</p>

<p>I've seen the drooping of spirits when
well meaning but poor expressing friends
came into the patient's room and condoned
and sorrowed with the patient.</p>

<p>Verily "as a man thinketh in his heart,
so is he."</p>

<p>Verily good cheer and good thought are
good medicines.</p>

<p>And to these truths all good doctors
say "Amen!"</p>

<h2><a name="READING" id="READING"></a>READING</h2>

<h3>Let Your Final Evening's Reading
be Good Stuff</h3>


<p>When you spend the evening playing
cards, the chances are you come home late,
and when you retire it takes perhaps an
hour or so before you fall to sleep.</p>

<p>And during the night you dream of
cards, of certain hands, of certain circumstances,
or certain persons, that were prominent
in the evening's game.</p>

<p>The reason you do not go to sleep after
an exciting evening is because you have
set your nerve carburetor at high tension
and forgotten to lower it before you go to
sleep.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when you have been
reading a restful book, full of good thought,
you establish an equilibrium, a relaxed
state of nerves and particularly you have
switched the current or direction of your
day's thoughts. That change spells rest,
and you retire and go to sleep easily.</p>

<p>In "Pep" one of the most beneficial suggestions
was that you read its chapters one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
or two each evening, after you had undressed,
and just before going to bed.</p>

<p>You will scarcely believe what a wondrous
change for the better will happen to you if
you make it a rule to have a brain clearing,
mental inventory, and nerve relaxation
every night before you sleep.</p>

<p>Your brain works at night always; oft-times
you have no remembrance of your
dreams, but if your last hour, before retiring,
was an hour of excitement, tension or
unusual occupation you will likely go over
it all again in your dreams.</p>

<p>If you will let nothing prevent your
period of soliloquy, or evening round-up,
you will establish your mental habits into
a rhythm that will give you peace, rest
and benefit.</p>

<p>In the olden days, when most families
had evening worship or family prayers, the
members of those households slept soundly
and restfully.</p>

<p>Particularly was this so because of the
habit formed of getting the mind on peaceful,
helpful, comforting, soul-satisfying
thoughts that remained fresh on the brain
tablets as the members of the home circle
went to sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the common practices in the home
circle is reading, and generally the books
or papers read are of the exciting, fascinating,
highly colored imaginative type; people
read stories of love, adventure, plot or
crime, and they dream these same things
most every night.</p>

<p>I have found that it pays to read two
classes of literature in the same evening.
First read your novel, story or fascinating
book, and fifteen minutes before you are
ready to go to sleep, read some good,
wholesome, helpful, uplifting book, and that
good stuff will be lastingly filed away in
your brain.</p>

<p>Finish your evening with books that are
interesting, yet educational. Such books as
"Life of the Bee" by Maeterlinck, or any
one of Fabre's wonderful books on insect
life; "Riddle of the Universe," by Haeckle;
Darwin's books; Drummond's "Ascent of
Man;" "Walks and Talks in Geological
Fields" is a splendid mental night cap;
"Power of Silence;" "Physiology of Faith and
Fear;" Emerson's "Essays;" Holmes' "Autocrat
of the Breakfast Table;" Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam; Tom Moore's Poems;
"Plutarch's Lives;" "Seneca;" "Addison;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Bulwer Lytton; Hugo; Carlyle's "Sartor
Resartus." This latter book will not fascinate
you like Carlyle's "French Revolution,"
but you will learn to love its fine
language, its fine analysis of character, of
times, and of things.</p>

<p>There are countless books of the good
improving kind. Always save one of them
for your solid reading, after you have read
light literature or novels. If you will get
the habit you will notice great benefits and
rapid advancement in your mental apparatus.</p>

<p>You will sleep better, think clearer; you
will learn to enjoy mental pleasures more
than material pleasures.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes then to be yours, yours
alone, in which you quiet, soothe, strengthen
and pacify yourself and add abundant
resources and assets.</p>

<p>Let the last reading in the evening be
something worth storing up in that precious
brain of yours and the good worth-while
deposit will grow and produce beautiful
worth-while mental fruit.</p>

<h2><a name="VERBOMANIA" id="VERBOMANIA"></a>VERBOMANIA</h2>

<h3>A Widely Prevalent Modern Disease</h3>


<p>The malady Verbomania is spreading
rapidly. What's that? You have never
heard of Verbomania? Well, then, it's
taken from verbosus, the Latin word meaning
abounding in words, the using of more
words than is necessary. Mania, also
Latin, means to rage&mdash;excessive or unreasonable
desire; therefore, Verbomania is
the excessive desire to use more words than
are necessary.</p>

<p>There is too much talk nowadays and
too little thinking. Some persons start
their gab carburetors and they talk and
talk mechanically, without any effort on
any thought, just like walking, the motion
just goes by itself.</p>

<p>Scientists have suggested that perhaps
too much talking without thinking is a
disease. I don't see why there is any
perhaps about it. Disease is an unnatural
condition, or function out of its natural
order of working.</p>

<p>We know we can sit down and run ideas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
through our brain without words and we
can use a lot of words without ideas.</p>

<p>You have read whole pages in a book
without receiving an idea. One can rattle
off words and not have ideas. When the
fountain of words flows in a desert of
ideas, it's Verbomania.</p>

<p>People in all walks of life have the
disease; they talk together too much without
any reason other than to take up time
or make themselves at ease.</p>

<p>Pink teas, receptions and society functions
are great rookeries for these Verbomania
birds to gather and indulge in their
gabfest.</p>

<p>The pianist through long practice is
able to play a difficult composition without
thinking about it; it's automatic; it's
habit in action.</p>

<p>The society dodo bird is just as dexterous
in spinning words without thought, as the
pianist with his difficult piece.</p>

<p>Our rapid mode of living, our conventions
and customs are responsible for much
of the Verbomania.</p>

<p>I should like to take my Dictophone to
a fussy "afternoon" and record the word
evacuations, the footless conversation, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
forced pleasantries, the set sentences that
mingle into a hum and buzz. A wilderness
of words in a barrenness of ideas.</p>

<p>This useless abuse of the use of speech
makes headaches, weariness, worry, unrest;
it saps strength, lowers pep, and lessens
resistance.</p>

<p>The cure for Verbomania is to keep away
from these butterfly buzz bees; put the
clothes-pin of caution on your lips; spend
more time alone with your thoughts. Nourish
your idea plants that have been starved;
prune your word plants.</p>

<p>Read the first few chapters of "PEP,"
particularly the chapter in the book about
solitude and sizing up things.</p>

<p>Don't expose yourself to the crowds
where the Verbomaniacs gather. The disease
is contagious; it's easy to acquire and
hard to retire.</p>

<p>These are ideas put in type to convey a

<h2><a name="HOME" id="HOME"></a>HOME</h2>

<h3>Don't Mistake a House for a Home</h3>


<p>Love builds homes, gold builds houses.
The home has a mongrel dog which is
called Prince, and all the family love it.
The house had a pedigreed bull pup that
is kept in the barn.</p>

<p>There is all the difference between the
family which has a home and the family
which has a house.</p>

<p>In houses we find broken hearts, worry,
nervous prostration, because there is idleness,
artificiality and aimlessness. In homes
we find warm hearts, happiness and love,
because those in the home have natural,
helpful occupation.</p>

<p>In the house is cold reserve; the occupants
read when compelled to stay in doors; they
grow crabbed and cross and get into a
state of habitual dumbness and selfishness.</p>

<p>In the home there is unselfishness,
thoughtfulness, and love expressed. Meal
time is joy time; it's the get-together period
of smiling faces.</p>

<p>In the house the breakfast table is merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a lunch station in the hurried trip from
the bedroom to the office.</p>

<p>The sensitive wife of the house gets
stinging remarks that abide with her after the
lord and master of the house has departed.</p>

<p>In the home the family gets up plenty
early enough, songs and jokes, kisses and
love pats are found, the family is on time,
and there is happiness all around.</p>

<p>Homes are sweet, because love is present.
Houses built by gold are just hotels.</p>

<p>I've noticed the difference when a friend
invites me to come to his home or his house;
the word he uses, home or house, indicates
to me what I will find when I go there.</p>

<p>In the house I meet a maid or butler at
the door. I see conventional furniture,
conventional rooms. I am shown into a
conventional waiting room, and I wait conventionally
for the hostess to come forward
with a stiff backbone, a forced smile, and a
languid hand shake.</p>

<p>When I go to a home built with love, I
find a tidy dressed wife at the door, rosy
children, and I get a warm old-fashioned
hand clasp, and a beaming smiling face
that spells welcome.</p>

<p>And the dinner, that too, tells the differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ence
between the "depend-on-the-cook"
housewife and the "wife-who-is-the-boss"
home.</p>

<p>At the house is formality and frigidity;
at the home is ease and enjoyment. The
children of the home make breaks and we
love them for it; it's natural instinct and
frankness.</p>

<p>In the house is worry; in the home is
happiness.</p>

<p>Verily there's a difference in the atmosphere
of the house built with gold and the
home built with love; one is worthless
existence, the other worth-while living.</p>

<h2><a name="DIET_RULES" id="DIET_RULES"></a>DIET RULES</h2>

<h3>Seven Sensible Simple Suggestions
on Eating</h3>


<p>I haven't time in this book to give reasons
or show proofs for everything I suggest. I
have explained much in detail regarding
the matter of food, thought, habit and
exercise in PEP, but I want right here to
give you a few definite, short, positive,
helpful rules that will pay you most wonderful
dividends in health and happiness.</p>

<p>First&mdash;Drink two or three glasses of
warm, not hot water the first thing when
you arise.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Repeat this resolve as you are
drinking the water, "I will be pleasant this
morning until ten o'clock and the rest of
the day will take care of itself."</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Walk to your office or place of
business unless it is over four miles, in
which case walk the first three miles and
ride the remainder of the distance.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;Eat one or two apples every
day, and do not insult nature's proper
adjustment by peeling the apple. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
want the skin because it has things in it
you need for your body, and especially for
your brain, and you need especially the
roughage the skin gives.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;Spend eight or nine hours a day
in bed. I belong to the sixty-three hour
club; that means nine hours a day rest,
seven days in a week, which is sixty-three
hours. If through business travel or other
circumstances I stay up late one or two
nights a week, I balance books before the
week is up by taking a rest on Sunday
afternoon or going to bed earlier one or
two nights.</p>

<p>Sixth&mdash;Don't stay in bed Sunday morning.
It will make you tired, loggy, stupid
and cross. Get up Sunday, say, a half
hour or an hour later than week days.
Later in the day take a nap if you wish.</p>

<p>Seventh&mdash;Spend fifteen minutes just before
going to bed in quiet, relaxed solitude.
This is the time to slow down your tension,
relax your muscles and soothe the nerves.
These rules you can easily remember and
if you follow them as I hope you will, the
red blood will course in your veins and
joy will be in your countenance and the
halo of happiness will be around your face.</p>

<h2><a name="NEGATIVE_ATTITUDE" id="NEGATIVE_ATTITUDE"></a>NEGATIVE ATTITUDE</h2>

<h3>A Frequent Crossed Current That
Makes Misery</h3>


<p>Every once in a while the human has a
negative day. Every act, thought, or
spoken sentence has a but, a don't, a can't,
or some other negative attachment to it.</p>

<p>The children laugh, play and cut up in
the morning and mother says, "I don't
know what I shall do with you, you are
just wearing me out." This puts a fear
thought and a weakness germ both in
mother and the kiddies.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon the family is resting;
mother maybe gets the blues, and says,
"What's the use, I never get anywhere,
go any place, it's just grind, work and worry
all the time."</p>

<p>Mother worries because there's a leak in
the roof and the water stained the paper
in the spare room. She worries because
she lives in a rented house and says, "I
have no heart to fix things up because this
is a rented house."</p>

<p>This negative thought indulged in brings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
on a misery state; it's worry, and the
worry comes because you dwell on the off
side of things. You rehearse your problem,
you go over your work, you count your
obstacles and pile up the negative and fear
thoughts.</p>

<p>Bless you, my dear sister, I know what
this negative can't, don't, but, and what's
the-use thought is and how it brings misery.
I know how the children get on your nerves
and make you say, "don't," all day to them.</p>

<p>There's only one way to drive out this
negative thought and that is to switch
your will power to the positive current.</p>

<p>Next time you have a negative day and
the fear thoughts come, just start in one
by one and count your blessings of health,
blessings of home, and blessings of love.</p>

<p>Nothing can hurt you. You've been
through these negative days time and time
again; the clouds gathered, you were blue,
lonesome, homesick and heartsick, but next
day you got busy with work, and occupation
drove away the clouds and the sunshine
came. The next Sunday you get in this
negative state, just put on your hat and
go out to see some neighbor or go to the
park or take a walk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Don't sit and stew and fret over your
magnified troubles.</p>

<p>Let the children play and laugh; they are
not hurting anyone. God bless them.
They don't have worries, their little lives
are all too short. Their example of smiles
and laughter should make you happy.
Soon, too soon, they will grow up and go
their ways in life and how precious will be
the memories of their carefree, golden,
happy childhood days.</p>

<p>Cut out envy; that's a mighty bad
negative wire. It's the devil's favorite
food to make worry and discontent.</p>

<p>Many of the people you envied in the
past are dead and buried. Many of the
people you envy now are at heart miserable,
and you wouldn't envy them if you could
look through the artificial outside and know
their real hidden thoughts and lives.</p>

<p>"What's-the-use;" that's a bad thing to
say, it plants worry seed.</p>

<p>You are all right, you have far more
blessings than sorrows. You can never be
free from troubles, cares or little irritations.</p>

<p>Rise superior to these things; those
around you are affected and susceptible to
your influence and example.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>If you have a "but," and "if," a "don't,"
tied to every command to your children,
they will recognize your uncertainty and
your negative hurtful attitude, and they
will take your threats, as well as your
promises, with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Be careful in giving commands; don't
put a Spanish bit in the children's mouths
to jerk them and torture them.</p>

<p>Be positive, make your promises and
orders stick, and the kiddies will soon know
you mean what you say.</p>

<p>These negative "driving me crazy" sentences
and attachments to your commands
spell weakness and make you drive, cajole
and spin out your orders and the children
hesitate, and are slow to obey.</p>

<p>Let them see your positive side. Let them
learn to obey with a "yes, mamma" spirit
and your orders will be less frequent, shorter
and they will be obeyed on the instant.</p>

<p>The kiddies learn to size you up, mamma,
and if they see a wobbly, worried, despondent,
unsure attitude in you, they will
discount your threats and make allowances,
saying "that's mamma's way."</p>

<p>Don't show your cry side but show your
smile side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Sunday is a great trial day for you,
mamma, but don't let your negative wires
get the best of you.</p>

<p>Sing as you make the beds and tidy up;
let sunshine in and drive out the gloom.</p>

<p>Blue Sundays are horror days for the
children; you can't expect them to sit still
like older folks. They are full of red blood
and active muscles.</p>

<p>Don't make Sunday a day of punishment
to your children. They get their cue from
you. Don't you be negative and cross, and
gloomy. It's bad business for you and all
the family.</p>

<h2><a name="WALKING" id="WALKING"></a>WALKING</h2>

<h3>The Best Exercise I Know of</h3>


<p>The benefits of walking are so quickly
apparent that I hope to get you to make
the start and keep it up for two weeks, and
then you will require no further urging.</p>

<p>In walking there are two things most
important to do in order to get the greatest
benefits: first&mdash;walk alone; second&mdash;walk
your natural gait.</p>

<p>So many people tell me they would like
to walk all, or part of the way, between
their home and office if they had company.</p>

<p>Company is the very thing you don't
want in walking, and there are two reasons
for this: one is if you walk with a friend
you will hold yourself back, or else you will
be walking faster than your natural gait,
and in either case it is a conscious effort,
and this conscious effort to a large degree
will cause you to lose much of the benefit
from your walk.</p>

<p>The most important reason, however, is
that if you walk with a friend you are sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to talk and thus you are using your nervous
energy and tiring your brain&mdash;the very
thing you should rest.</p>

<p>Walking gives you physical exercise which
is absolutely necessary for health. It is
the best exercise I know of because you
do not overdo your strength.</p>

<p>Walking is beneficial because when you
walk alone you give your brain a rest.
You cannot read the papers, you cannot
talk, and your mental apparatus gets complete
rest.</p>

<p>As stated in PEP I walk from my home
to my office, something less than four
miles, and it takes me about an hour to
make the trip. I walk through a beautiful
park and every morning I see something
new and interesting in bird and animal life,
in the vegetation and in the geological
formations through which I pass.</p>

<p>I recommend that you walk anywhere
from three to four miles in the morning.</p>

<p>If your home is more than four miles
from the office, walk three or four miles
and then take the car.</p>

<p>Do not walk home in the evening unless
the walk is a short one. In the evening
you are tired and you should conserve your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
strength. In the morning you are fresh
and the exercise comes to you at a time it
is most needed. It will give you strength,
courage and help to keep you in a good mood
all day.</p>

<p>I cannot too strongly emphasize the
importance of walking alone, for then you
have shifted your nerve energy from the
dry cell battery of the brain to the magneto,
which is the spinal cord. The spinal cord
works automatically and it doesn't wear
itself out. The brain tires if it uses its
energy.</p>

<p>In walking you use the thought and the
brain impulse to start the magneto
then the spinal cord action is automatic.</p>

<p>This automatic action of the spinal cord
is a wise provision of nature to conserve
strength.</p>

<p>The spinal cord energy is what you might
call automatic habit.</p>

<p>For instance, in dressing and undressing
yourself you will recall that you put on or
take off your clothes in regular order without
giving the matter any thought. It
is just habit.</p>

<p>If you wish to demonstrate the difference
between the control of the physical body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
by brain impulse and the spinal cord impulse,
try this some morning: Start out
on your walk, and mentally frame sentences
like this as you walk, "right step, left
step, right step, left step," and so on;
give thought to each step you have taken
and notice how tired you will be when you
have gone half a mile.</p>

<p>The next morning start to walk, walk
naturally, give no thought to walking, keep
your mind on the beauties of nature by
which you are passing or in pleasant
soliloquy and you will feel no fatigue.</p>

<p>There isn't a bit of theory in this chapter;
it is positive practical sense I have proved
by my own experiences and by the experiences
of everyone to whom I have made
this suggestion of walking alone.</p>

<p>The moral is this&mdash;walk every morning
and walk ALONE.</p>

<h2><a name="ELIMINATION" id="ELIMINATION"></a>ELIMINATION</h2>

<h3>The Body's Safety-First in Keeping
Health</h3>


<p>The body is made up of billions of little
cells. These individual cells are in a state
of perpetual activity. They exhaust, wear
away, break down with work and rebuild
on food and rest. Every process of life&mdash;the
beat of the heart, the throb of the brain
in thought, the digestion of food, the
excretion of waste&mdash;all are due to the
activity of groups of highly specialized
individual cells.</p>

<p>Every cell uses up its own material and
throws off poisonous by-products during
activity. These by-products, or wastes,
are very poisonous to the individual cell as
well as to the entire organism. To get rid
of this waste is one of the first duties of
the system.</p>

<p>It is with the body, made up of its countless
millions of individual cells, just as with
a city and its myriad people: the sewage
of the community must be collected and
disposed of. The city forms its poisons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
which we call sewage and the body its
poisons, which we call excreta (or carbonic
acid, urea, uric acid, faeces, etc.) It is no
more important for a city to gather up
and get rid of its poisonous sewage than
for the animal organism to collect and
excrete its cell-waste. Hence, the importance
of maintaining normal and constant
elimination throughout the body.</p>

<p>Elimination is kept up by the alimentary
tract, the kidneys, the skin, and the lungs.</p>

<p>These four are the great pipe-line sewerage
systems so to speak, by which the body
throws off its gaseous, liquid and solid
poisons.</p>

<p>The lungs momentarily strain carbonic
acid out of the blood and throw it out in
the expired air. They likewise exhale other
noxious matters from the system.</p>

<p>The alimentary tract throws off faeces,
made up of the waste tissue from the whole
system, especially the digestive organs, as
well as indigestible and non-nutritious portions
of the food.</p>

<p>The kidneys strain out urea, uric acid,
and certain other poisons from the blood
and eject them through the urinary tract.</p>

<p>Finally the skin likewise is an excretory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
organ and exhales a very definite amount
of gaseous and fluid waste in the course of
each twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The skin throws off from a pint to two
quarts of liquid each day in the form of vapor.</p>

<p>Thus, to carry on normal elimination
from the body, the breathing, digesting,
urinary and cutaneous systems must be
kept working normally. To impair the
work of any of these is to retard bodily
drainage. To insure that elimination is
going on naturally it is necessary to secure
perfect functioning of lungs, bowels, kidneys
and the skin.</p>

<p>Any stoppage in the process of elimination
means that some fault has crept into
the work of one of these excretory systems.
It must be plain now why a disorder of
any one of these organs of elimination
means so much more profound disturbance
to the whole organization than merely
disease in one structure; it means that
waste products are retained which ought to
be thrown out of the body; so straightway
every cell in the body begins to be more or
less affected. Some poisons disturb one
organ more and some another, but in the
end the whole body must be affected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Lack of exercise, bolting of food, eating
soft, starchy things, failure to chew properly,
failure to get enough roughage, insufficient
water, insufficient fruit, these are
the general causes of stoppage in the
elimination processes.</p>

<p>Drink one or two glasses of warm, not
hot, water first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Eat one or two apples, skins and all,
every day. Eat toast, especially the crust,
eat cracked wheat or whole wheat bread
often.</p>

<p>Exercise plenty. Keep cheerful, eat regularly.</p>

<p>Very likely you eat too much. You don't
need three big meals a day unless you work
out doors at hard physical labor.</p>

<p>Your body is an engine. No use to keep
the boiler red hot and two hundred pounds
of steam if your work is light.</p>

<p>Good health depends upon proper assimilation
and elimination as nature intended.</p>

<p>Eat less, exercise more, you who work
indoors. If you don't use this caution
you are just slowly killing yourself.</p>

<h2><a name="CONTINUOUS_HAPPINESS" id="CONTINUOUS_HAPPINESS"></a>CONTINUOUS HAPPINESS</h2>

<h3>An Impossible State, and It's Well It's So</h3>


<p>I am often asked, "Are you happy ALL
the time?" My answer is no.</p>

<p>A continuous state of happiness cannot
be enjoyed by any human. There are no
plans, no habits, no methods of living that
will insure unbroken happiness.</p>

<p>Happiness means periods or marking
posts in our journey along life's road.
These high points of bliss are enjoyed because
we have to walk through the low
places between times.</p>

<p>Continuous sunshine, continuous warm
weather, continuous rest, continuous travel,
continuous anything spells monotony. We
must have variety.</p>

<p>We need the night to make us enjoy the
day, winter to make us enjoy summer,
clouds to make us enjoy sunshine, sorrow
to make us enjoy happiness.</p>

<p>But, dear reader, mark this: we can be
philosophical and have content, serenity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and poise between the happiness periods.</p>

<p>When you get blue, or have dread or
sorrow, or that undescribable something
that makes you feel badly; when you have
worry or trouble, then's the time to get
hold of your thinking machinery, and modify
the shadows that come across you.</p>

<p>Occupation and focusing your thoughts
on your blessings, these are the methods to
employ.</p>

<p>As long as you dwell upon your imagined
or your real sorrows you will be miserable
and the worries will magnify like gathering
clouds in April.</p>

<p>Take the stand of changing your thoughts
to confidence, faith, and good cheer, and
busy your hands with work. Think of the
happiness periods you have had and know
there is happiness dividends coming to you.
Keep this sort of thought and with it useful
occupation, and the sunshine will dispel the
clouds in your thoughts like the sun dispels
the April showers and brings about a more
beautiful day because of the clouds and
storms just passed.</p>

<p>When trouble or sorrows come, sweeten
your cup with sugar remembrances of joys
you've had and joys you are to have.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Envy no one; envy breeds worry. The
person you would envy has his sorrows and
shadows, too; you see him only when the
sunlight is on the face, you don't see him
when he is in shadowland.</p>

<p>No, dear ones, I nor you, nor anyone on
earth can have complete, unruffled, continued
happiness, but we can brace up and
call our reserve will power, reason, and self-confidence
to bear when we come to the
marshy places along the road. We can
pick our steps and get through the mire
and sooner than we believe it possible we
can get on the good solid ground; and as
we travel, happiness will often come as a
reward for our poise and patience.</p>

<p>My friends say, "you always seem
happy," and in that saying they tell a
truth, for I am happy often, very, very
often and between times I make myself
seem to be happy. This making myself
"seem to be happy" gives me serenity,
contentment, fortitude, and the very "seeming"
soon blossoms into a reality of the
condition I seem to be in.</p>

<p>You can be happy often and when you
are not happy, just seem to be happy anyway;
it will help you much.</p>

<h2><a name="SELF_ACCUSATION" id="SELF_ACCUSATION"></a>SELF ACCUSATION</h2>

<h3>If You Do This You Will Always Be
Miserable</h3>


<p>Many have the habit of keeping their
minds on their weaknesses or their shortcomings.</p>

<p>If they read of some one doing a great
thing or making a worth-while accomplishment
they say, "I never could do such a
thing."</p>

<p>These persons are always saying, "I never
have luck. I can't do this. I can't do
that."</p>

<p>Always knocking, always thinking can't
instead of can, will make fear, irresoluteness,
uncertainty and weakness of character.</p>

<p>Saying "I can't, I haven't the ability,
I am unlucky" and such like makes you
weak and knocks out all chance for doing
things.</p>

<p>Nothing comes out of the brain that
wasn't burned in by thought. If you accuse
yourself, belittle your capacity, or drown
your good impulses with doubt and self-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>accusation,
you are putting away a lot of
bad thought in your brain and no wonder you
will lack in initiative, ambition and courage.</p>

<p>To those who claim to be unlucky I want
to say you are not unlucky, you simply lack
pluck.</p>

<p>You start at undertakings with a handicap
of fear, and a made-up mind you can't
accomplish. No one ever got anywhere
with anything with such a millstone around
his neck.</p>

<p>Many a man has been whipped in a
fight, defeated in a contest, or beaten at an
undertaking, but he didn't show it or let
the other fellow know it; he just kept on
with a brave front and finally the other
fellow quit, mistaking grim determination,
pluck and perseverance for strength and
victory.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen with his handful of men
was asked to surrender by the British
general with his superior force. By all
rights and rules of war Ethan was licked,
but he didn't give in. He replied, "Surrender
h&mdash;ll; I've just commenced to fight."
If Ethan had accused himself and said, "I
can't whip that big bunch, there's no hope,"
he would have been whipped to a finish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Don't show the enemy, or the world,
your weakness. Don't admit anything impossible
that is capable of accomplishment.</p>

<p>It's the "I can" man who wins. No man
ever won a fight if he started out by saying,
"I can't whip him, he is too much for me,
I am no match for him, but I'll try."</p>

<p>No person ever made success in business
if he started in with uncertainty, lack of
confidence and unbelief in his ability.</p>

<p>Knock yourself and the world will accept
you at your own estimate. Show streaks of
yellow cowardice and the mob will pounce
on you like a pack of hungry wolves.</p>

<p>Accuse yourself, curse your luck, belittle
your worth, be afraid, and you will remain
a mere bump on a log, unnoticed, uninteresting,
uninvited.</p>

<p>The world welcomes men who do things.
The world judges by outward appearances.
If your heart is sick, if your courage is low,
don't show it. Put up a stiff attitude and
act with confidence and that attitude will
carry you over many a pitfall and past
many an obstacle.</p>

<p>Show strength and the world will help
you; show weakness and the world will shun
you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>You are prejudiced when it comes to
judging yourself. You compare your weakness
with your friends' strength and this comparison
is unfair; it makes you lose confidence.</p>

<p>Nothing hurts one worse than doubting
one's own ability, assets, and character.</p>

<p>When you find yourself experiencing
doubt, or inability, or hard luck, turn
square around and say "Begone, doubt;
henceforth I have belief."</p>

<p>Suggest and say "I have ability; I have
pluck and pluck means luck."</p>

<p>Always express confidence, faith, courage,
and cheer thoughts, whether you feel
them or not. Do this heroically and persistently
and soon the fear shadows and
weakness feelings will leave you and you
will be in reality strong, courageous, active,
and you will do things you never thought
possible.</p>

<p>"As a man thinketh, so is he;" always
remember that.</p>

<p>Get hold of your thoughts; make yourself
think up, and have faith and courage.
Hold to your resolve and the whole world
will change. You will prosper, you will
have poise, and every once in a while
happiness will come as a reward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>No man will be surprised at your complete
change of attitude and character more
than yourself.</p>

<p>Your problems can only be solved by
yourself. Friends can advise, I can suggest,
but YOU must act.</p>

<p>Henceforth never accuse yourself, never
feel sorry for your condition or position,
cut out fear thoughts,&mdash;be strong.</p>

<p>Think faith, courage, cheer, confidence,
and strength, and by-and-by the habit will
be fixed, and natural.</p>

<p>This is as certain truth as I have ever
experienced. I know it. I've tried it.
I've watched others and the results are
always good.</p>

<p>Don't be passive and forget this chapter.
Start right this minute to THINK RIGHT.</p>

<p>And you will never regret and never forget
this chapter of Self-accusation.</p>

<h2><a name="WOMANS_BEAUTY" id="WOMANS_BEAUTY"></a>WOMAN'S BEAUTY</h2>

<h3>Every Woman Will Be Interested in
These Pointers</h3>


<p>Sisters, it's your duty to keep your good
looks as long as possible, and to do it you
must spend time each and every day on
the care of your face and hair.</p>

<p>First of all, you must keep your skin
clean, and that's a particular job.</p>

<p>You have nearly thirty miles of pores in
your body. These pores are sewers; they
discharge in a healthy person nearly two
pounds of waste material every day.</p>

<p>If these pores are stopped up or clogged,
the waste material is secreted in the skin.</p>

<p>The stopped pores secrete the greasy
waste matter. This greasy substance attracts
dirt, dust and germs, and soon
blackheads, pimples or blotched skin will
result.</p>

<p>Washing the skin with strong soap is not
good.</p>

<p>To keep the skin clear and healthy you
should massage it with cold cream and rub
gently but thoroughly. This rubbing or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
massage quickens circulation, strengthens
the little capillary veins and brings that
beautiful pink glow that is so attractive.</p>

<p>The cold cream softens the dry waste
secretion and makes it easier to come out.</p>

<p>After the cold cream application, rub all
the grease off with a rough towel.</p>

<p>Don't forget the daily massage; it will
work wonders in your appearance. It will
help give you that fresh, healthy appearance
nature intends the fair sex to have.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of the sun. Tan is health
to the skin and tan with pink shades beneath
it is a pretty combination.</p>

<p>In washing the hair do not use any compound
that has ammonia in it. Ammonia
will bring on the gray hairs.</p>

<p>Occasionally you must wash the hair with
soap, but let the soap be mild.</p>

<p>Raw eggs make an excellent shampoo or
hair cleaner. The egg does not take out
the natural oil necessary to good hair health.</p>

<p>Glycerine and water and lanoline makes
a good wash; after using rinse the hair with
hot soft water to get out all the glycerine
and lanoline.</p>

<p>Rub the roots of the hair frequently with
the ends of your fingers, move the scalp in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
circular motion; this is to stimulate the
scalp nerves and blood vessels and the
glands and roots of the hair. Scalp massage
is wonderfully beneficial.</p>

<p>The foregoing are the mechanical things
to do for the skin and hair. They help, but
the real benefit to your looks comes from
the bodily health and natural working of
the organs, particularly the stomach, lungs,
heart and kidneys and bowels.</p>

<p>The most important organs to watch are
the kidneys and stomach; their ailments
quickly show effects on the face.</p>

<p>Drink plenty of water, cool, not cold;
get plenty of air and sunshine. Eat plenty
of fruit, especially apples, skins too.</p>

<p>Take exercise in the open air every day.
Walking is the best exercise.</p>

<p>Air, water, sunshine and exercise will do
more for your looks than a barrel of beauty
preparations.</p>

<p>The only way to get health out of a
bottle is to keep out of the bottle.</p>

<p>You can't buy beauty at the druggists.</p>

<p>We love our friends for their character,
not their skin beauty. Have good wholesome
health and wholesome character and
you will look mighty good to the world.</p>

<h2><a name="DREAMS" id="DREAMS"></a>DREAMS</h2>

<h3>Hitch Your Wagon to a Star, and
Stay Hitched</h3>


<p>The great colleges are just now turning
out their thousands of graduates and the
great newspapers have much sport ridiculing
them with funny pictures.</p>

<p>Every great man was once a boy with a
dream, and that dream came true because
the boy had pep that made him stick to his
ambition and kept him from being discouraged
because of ridicule or obstacles.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle, the poor Scotch tutor,
dreamed he wanted to be a great author.
His clothes were threadbare, his poverty
apparent; friends taunted and ridiculed
him until, goaded to indignation, he cried,
"I have better books in me than you have
ever read." The crowd laughed and said,
"poor fellow, he's daffy in the head."</p>

<p>Carlyle stuck to his dream and the world
has the "History of Frederick the Great"
and the "French Revolution" and "Sartor
Resartus." When he had finished the
manuscript of the "French Revolution" a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
careless maid built a fire with it. He wasn't
discouraged, but went to work and wrote
it over again and very likely better than
he wrote it the first time.</p>

<p>Bonaparte in the garden of his military
school dreamed of being a great general.
He stuck to his dream and he realized his
hopes.</p>

<p>Joseph Pulitzer, a poor emigrant, crawled
in a cellar way to sleep in New York, and
he dreamed of owning a great newspaper.
His dream came true and the newspaper is
printed in a building erected on the spot
where he dreamed in the cellar way.</p>

<p>Livingston dreamed of exploring darkest
Africa; his dream came true.</p>

<p>Edison dreamed of great electrical discoveries.
His monument is Menlo Park
with its great laboratories.</p>

<p>Ford dreamed of making an automobile
for the purse-limited masses&mdash;he was jeered;
today the world cheers him.</p>

<p>My friend Bert Perrine was chucked off
a stage in the middle of Idaho's great sage
brush desert. He said to the driver, "Some
day I'll own that stage and I'll use it for a
chicken house."</p>

<p>He dreamed and schemed and today the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
desert is the famous Twin Falls country,
blossoming like a rose, and on his beautiful
ranch at Blue Lakes that old stage is
used for a chicken house.</p>

<p>Rockefeller dreamed, Lincoln dreamed, so
did Garfield, Wilson, Grant, Clay, Webster,
Marshall Field, Richard W. Sears and all
the other men who have done things worth
while in the world.</p>

<p>The great West is the result of dreams
come true.</p>

<p>Dream on, my boy; hitch your wagon to
a star and stay hitched. That dream and
that determination are the things that are
to carry you over obstacles, past thorny
ways, and through criticism, jeers and
ridicule.</p>

<p>Your time will come. Dream and scheme,
and make your ideals materialize into living,
pulsating realities.</p>

<h2><a name="REAL_CHARITY" id="REAL_CHARITY"></a>REAL CHARITY</h2>

<h3>Let Me Help Where I Am Rather
Than Help in Siam</h3>


<p>There are many persons who act and
advocate ideals merely for effect&mdash;they are
hypocrites.</p>

<p>Here's a little true heart story that
probably passed unnoticed excepting to a
very few persons.</p>

<p>Little Spencer Nelson, a poor boy, eight
years old, recently died in a hospital with
a little bank clasped to his breast. The
bank had $3.41 in pennies the boy had
saved to buy presents for poor children.</p>

<p>The little hero had fought manfully
through three months' suffering, enduring
the torture of five lacerating operations.
The pain failed to dim his spirit of unselfishness
that burned brightly and clearly in
his tired, fever-racked body.</p>

<p>After each operation his mind became
more securely fixed on his project to help
bring cheer to poor children.</p>

<p>A little savings bank was his companion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and each visitor was asked to contribute to
his fund.</p>

<p>Three hours before he died a smile beautified
his thin wasted face as the nurse
dropped a dime in his bank. His last
words were to his mother and the message
was in a scarcely audible whisper, asking
her to remember to use the money to make
poor children happy.</p>

<p>That was real charity; that boy had no
hypocrisy in his heart.</p>

<p>The daily paper chronicles sensational
charity, where men vie with each other to
see who can give most and get the most
advertising. They overlook the wonderful
love and charity they are capable of, if
they would look into out-of-the-way places
and get direct connection with pain and
suffering.</p>

<p>Little Spencer looked from his cot and
saw the suffering of other little children and
he wanted to help them, and the very
resolve and impulse made him forget his
own pains and misery.</p>

<p>In the Book of Good Deeds the name of
Spencer Nelson will be recorded as a
sweeter act of charity than any million-dollar
gift to a great institution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>What one of you who read these lines can
read the story of that little hero and not be
touched by the generous love and beautiful
conception of charity he possessed.</p>

<p>He did not need sensational stories in
newspapers or solicitors of charitable organizations
to stir him to action.</p>

<p>He found opportunity at his door, close
at home, near by, where all of us can find
it if we only look.</p>

<p>I don't believe much in this far-away
charity idea so many have.</p>

<p>I believe in helping those near where I
am rather than sending money to Siam.</p>

<p>It may be a pleasurable sensation for
you to contribute fifty dollars to a missionary
scheme in Siam, and get the Missionary
report of the budget made up from the
foreign missionary fund.</p>

<p>I know that a bucket of coal in an empty
stove, a basket of bread and liberal hunk of
round steak to the starving family around the
corner brings the donor a better sensation.</p>

<p>Take a trip to the hospitals, learn about
the homes of the suffering patients in the
charity ward, and you will resolve it's a
better act to send flour to the poor than
flowers to the rich.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Spencer Nelson had the right idea
of charity: definite, immediate help to those
he could reach right where he was, rather
than sending money to sufferers far, far
away.</p>

<p>Let your gifts be principally flour and
beef; they help those who need help.
Flowers are all right in their place, but
there are more places where flour can be
used to better purpose.</p>

<p>I'm keener for filling the coffee can of
my suffering neighbor than filling the coffers
of the big charity five thousand miles away.</p>

<p>I try to help both ways, but the home
help pays the bigger dividends. What do
you think about it?</p>

<h2><a name="FRIENDS" id="FRIENDS"></a>FRIENDS</h2>

<h3>A Most Abused, Too Often Used
Word</h3>


<p>You have found a friend who has been
so much help and comfort to you. I have
such a friend. Tonight I am in the mood
to think of that friend and write him a
letter like this:</p>

<p>This is to You. It is for You. It is
about You. You I have in mind and the
good influence you have had on me. It is
a happiness and satisfaction to know you,
and to bask in the atmosphere of you.</p>

<p>The world is better because of you. You
have helped to raise the average.</p>

<p>You and your goodness, you do not appreciate
what that means. You are so modest,
so loath to think of yourself, so unselfish
in this respect that I must tell you of you
and about you.</p>

<p>You have a warm heart that throbs for
others' woes and holds sympathy. The
great world is cold, selfish, and cares little
for others. But you are different; you are
a great pillow of rest on which I and others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
who love you may lay our tired, weary
heads, and you wrap your arms of friendship
and goodness about us and feel our
very heartbeats.</p>

<p>You with your great goodness, your
quiet, sympathetic understanding, you
soothe our troubled spirits and make us
glad of you and glad we have the precious
privilege of knowing you.</p>

<p>Even now as I am telling you how I love
you, you are trying to wave me aside and
stop me, but I am in the mood and I want
to express myself. You know that there is
a great sin of omission, which is the refraining
of expressing gratitude for goodness
extended to us.</p>

<p>I want to express my gratitude. I do
not want to be guilty of the sin of omission.</p>

<p>So here then for you is this little message,
to tell you I appreciate you, I love you, and
these words will last after you are gone and
after I am gone, to tell those of tomorrow
about you and what those of today thought
about you.</p>

<p>You life, your goodness, is an everlasting
plant that will flourish in many hearts.
Your influence will last beyond the calendar
of time; it is indestructible. You have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
great credit in the universal bank of good
deeds, where you have deposited worth-*while
acts, deeds, kindnesses, cheer, help,
friendship, sympathy, courage, gratitude,
and all the precious jewels worth while.</p>

<p>I am happy the very moment I think of
you. I try to express myself but feelings
and emotions I would describe have not
words or sentences to express them. You
understand, you are so big in heart, so
sensitive in fabric of feeling, so wise in
understanding, that I want you to think
and feel all the genuine, noble, lovable,
appreciative thoughts you can gather together
about the one you most appreciate.</p>

<p>Think hard, sincerely, deeply, about that
one, with all your resources of beautiful
thought. Think hard that way and now
you will begin to understand what I feel
about you, and how I appreciate you.</p>

<p>You, my inspiration, you who are so
sensitized to feeling, so delicately adjusted
to read heart vibrations, you must feel this
within me I am trying to convey to you.
Not the love between sweethearts, not the
love of kin, not the love of friends, but a
great universal love I have for you&mdash;a love
all who know you have for you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a love you cannot return to me in
equal measure, because you have not the
object in me that can merit such love.
That you should love me in the way I love
you, even in the most diminished proportions,
is satisfaction supreme.</p>

<p>It is glorious to know you. You water
the good impulses I have, you encourage
all that is noble, elevating, and bettering,
in me. I shall try to be like you, that is,
so far as I can. You are my model, there
is but one you. Many may copy you, none
equal you. You my comfort, you my joy.
A great glorious you, that a little I am
trying to paint a picture of.</p>

<p>How futile my efforts. I might as well
try to improve the deep beautiful colors of
the morning glory, or try to retint the lily
with more beautiful white.</p>

<p>And so I bid you good-bye, happy that
there is such a you in the world, more
happy that I know you, and most happy
that I know how to appreciate you.</p>

<p>The sum of all good things I can say, is
I love you, and the word "love" I use in
its greatest, broadest sense, which covers
all the good adjectives.</p>

<p>This is what I think of YOU.</p>

<h2><a name="MANS_DANGER_PERIOD" id="MANS_DANGER_PERIOD"></a>MAN'S DANGER PERIOD</h2>

<h3>In the Midday of Your Life, Look
Out</h3>


<p>There is a time in the business man's life
between the age of 48 and 52 when the man
undergoes a pronounced change in his life.</p>

<p>More big men are cut off at 50 than at
any other age between 45 and 60.</p>

<p>At 48 to 52 most men change vitally in
their physical and mental make-up.</p>

<p>Many men, hitherto straight, moral men,
go to the bad at this time, and per contra
many men quit their immoral and health
hurting habits and change to moral men.</p>

<p>This danger period is when the newly-rich
find fault with their wives who have
helped them to their success. They grow
tired of their wives and seek the companionship
of young women.</p>

<p>The divorce courts give most interesting
figures on this point.</p>

<p>At this danger period men who have been
high livers, voracious eaters and heavy
drinkers find themselves victims of diabetes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Bright's disease or other forms of kidney
troubles.</p>

<p>Most every man between 48 and 52 who
works indoors, eats too much, exercises too
little, sleeps insufficiently.</p>

<p>Here are a few things for the 50-year-old
man to do:</p>

<p>Drink two glasses of warm, not hot,
water immediately on arising.</p>

<p>Eat an apple before breakfast; positively
you must eat the skins too. The skins have
the phosphorus, phosphates, and brain food.
The skins make roughage and keep the
alimentary tract active.</p>

<p>Eat for breakfast a little bacon, cooked
rare; crisp bacon has all the good fried out,
and you simply have ashes left.</p>

<p>One cup of coffee, an egg or two, some
cereal and toast, no red meat, no potatoes.</p>

<p>Walk to your office if it is less than three
miles; if over three miles ride the extra
distance, but walk three miles anyway.</p>

<p>Walk alone. This is most important; it
relaxes your brain. Walking with company
makes it a physical exertion and a
mental pull as well, for a man will talk
when he has company.</p>

<p>Eat a light lunch; be sure to eat an apple;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
with it drink two or three glasses of water,
cool but not cold.</p>

<p>Let your hearty meal be supper, eat
slowly and don't talk business. After supper
play with the kids or joke with your
wife; get a smile on your face.</p>

<p>Just before you retire read a chapter from
a worth-while book. The last thoughts
which you take in at night are the ones
which stick.</p>

<p>Leave your business in your business
clothes, and get in a good night's sleep.</p>

<p>Keep a sharp look-out for tendencies to
change your habits and morals.</p>

<p>At 50 you are walking on thin ice; look
out, danger is near.</p>

<p>After you are 55 your habits are pretty
well established. If you have lived rightly
till then you're safe thereafter and likely on
your way to a good ripe old age if you take
reasonable care of yourself.</p>

<h2><a name="OUR_SONS" id="OUR_SONS"></a>OUR SONS</h2>

<h3>They Pattern After Us; Be Worth
Copying</h3>


<p>We love our own the best; maybe that's
why we indulge our own too much. Our
duty to our boys: that's a subject old as
the hills and it is as important as it is old.</p>

<p>Today I had the boy problem forcibly
presented to me. Today in court twenty-four
boys were brought before the Judge
charged with petty crimes. Three were
sent to the penitentiary, seven to reform
school and fourteen let go temporarily on
good behavior.</p>

<p>A friend of mine interested in criminology
tells me the great bulk of hold-ups, thefts,
burglaries and murders are committed by
boys between 16 and 22 years of age.</p>

<p>These twenty-four boys I mention were
just ordinary boys, capable of making good
citizens if they had had the right kind of
home treatment and surroundings. Most
of them got in trouble through their association
with "gangs" or "the bunch," or
the "crowd," and this because daddy didn't
have his hand on the rein.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>That boy must have companionship; he
must have a confidante to whom he can
share his joys, his sorrows, his hopes, his
ambitions. If he doesn't get this comeraderie
at home he gets it "round the
corner."</p>

<p>We know where the boy is when he is at
school, but how few know the boy's doings
between times.</p>

<p>Pool halls tempt the boys, and these
places are breeding places where filthy
stories, criminal slang and evil practices
are hatched.</p>

<p>Pool halls and saloons invite and fascinate
the boy. He sees the lights. There is a
keen pleasure in watching the pink-shirted
dude with cigarette in his mouth making
fancy shots.</p>

<p>There is no one to nag him or bother him;
it gets to be his "hang-out," and soon he
drifts into a crowd that knows the trail to
the red light district.</p>

<p>Painted fairies dazzle the giddy boy. It
takes money to go the pace. Crime is
gilded over with slang words. Stealing is
called "easy money." Robbery is "turning
a trick," and so on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>A boy becomes what he lives on mentally
and physically; that's the net of it.</p>

<p>If Dad is his chum, if sister shares with
him his amusements, if the family work
and live on the "all for one and one for all"
plan, if the boy is kept busy and interested,
he can be easily trained.</p>

<p>Neglect him and he will neglect you.
Love him and he will love you. Meet him
half way; he's impressionable.</p>

<p>Show him kindness, he will respond.
Show him example, he will follow.</p>

<p>You have to be with him or know where
he is every minute.</p>

<p>During his period of adolescence, say
from twelve or thirteen to sixteen or seventeen,
that boy is a mass of plaster of paris,
easily shaped while plastic, but once set,
impossible to recast.</p>

<p>That's the time, Dad, you must be on
YOUR job with your boy.</p>

<p>Your counsel, example, love, interest and
teaching will MAKE the boy.</p>

<p>Think of these things, Dad, and think
hard, and think hard NOW. Tomorrow
may be too late.</p>

<h2><a name="RELIGIOUS_EXTREMES" id="RELIGIOUS_EXTREMES"></a>RELIGIOUS EXTREMES</h2>

<h3>Form, Frills, Ceremony vs. Excitement,
Ecstacy, Enthusiasm</h3>


<p>Many churches today are running to
extremes one way or the other.</p>

<p>On the one hand they are conducted along
the lines of form, ceremony and ritualism,
while the other extreme is excitement,
ecstacy and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The church of form, rituals and ceremonies
attracts the passive who are willing
to let the priest or pastor or prelate take
charge of the religious work while they, the
attendants or worshippers, sit quietly by
and say amen and join in the responses.</p>

<p>Paul said, "Away with those forms."
Christ in ministering to humanity gave no
forms or made no set sentences for his
followers. The Lord's Prayer was given
with the admonition, "After this manner
pray ye," and certainly not with the command,
pray ye with these words.</p>

<p>Form, ceremony and rituals are much
like most associated charities, a sort of
convention. Forms can not express the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
deep emotions, the natural longings, or the
human desires; they are echoes, hollow and
unsatisfying.</p>

<p>For those who do not feel, for those who
do not act, for those who belong to churches
because of convention, or for social reasons,
form and frills fill the bill.</p>

<p>Form is an exterior religion, an outward
show. Form doesn't touch the heart or
awaken the soul. Form in religion is like
a formal dinner. It is show rather than a
plan to satisfy human heart hunger.</p>

<p>Opposite to formal religion is the frenzied
"scare-you-to-death" excitement method,
which relies upon mental intoxication to
stir the people, and like other forms of
intoxication, the effect soon wears off.</p>

<p>I have little patience or sympathy for the
business men who hire professional evangelists
to come to town to start revivals.
The sensational revivalists have too acute
appreciation of the dollar to convince me
of their sincerity in their work.</p>

<p>A laborer is worthy of his hire, and a
preacher, teacher or benefactor of any sort
should be well paid. But when I see these
big guns taking away ten to twenty thousand
dollars in cold cash for three weeks'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
campaign converting the poor suffering
people, the thought comes to me, that if
the evangelist is sincere he should buy a lot
of bread, coal and underwear and hire a lot
of trained nurses with a big part of that
money.</p>

<p>Christ and his Apostles were of the
people; they worked with, and among the
people; they had no committees, no guarantees
and no business men's subscription
lists.</p>

<p>It's mighty hard to read about these
sensational evangelists taking in thousands
of dollars for a couple of weeks' revival
meetings, and harmonize that religion with
the religion of Christ, the carpenter, and
his Apostles, who were fishermen and workmen.</p>

<p>The excitement, intoxicating, frenzy revival
method is pretty much always the
same in its working. The evangelist starts
in with the song "Where is My Wandering
Boy Tonight," then follows the picture of
mother, which is painted with sobs of blood.
Then follows mother's death-bed scene until
the audience is in tears. Gesticulation,
mimicry, acting, sensationalism, slang and
weepy stories follow, until the ferment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
excitement is developed into a high state
and droves flock to the altar to be made
over on the instant into sanctified beings.</p>

<p>The evangelist stays until his engagement
is up, and then departs with a pocket full
of nice fat bank drafts.</p>

<p>It is a sad commentary on the established
profession of ministry that sensational professionals
are called in and paid fabulous
prices to convert the people in their community.</p>

<p>I do not take much stock in either the
frigid form with its frills or the frenzied
fire and brimstone, scare-you-to-it extremes.</p>

<p>Somewhere between these extremes is the
rational natural sane road to travel; the
religion of brotherly love; of cheers, not
tears; of hope, not fear; of courage, not
weakness; of joy, not sorrow; of help, not
hindrance.</p>

<p>The religion that makes us love one
another here, not the kind that says we
shall know each other there. The religion
that has to do with human passions, human
trials, human needs, instead of the frigid
form or the fevered frenzy; the religion that
avoids the extremes of heat and cold, that's
the kind the world needs most.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Christ taught love, kindness, charity, and
not beautiful churches, opera singing choirs.
He spoke not of robes, vestments, forms or
rituals.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful things in the
Bible is the story of the good Samaritan
with his simple, unostentatious aid to a
wounded man, an enemy of his people
whom the Samaritan knew was none the
less a brother. And you will remember
the priest of the temple, the man who
taught charity, and love, drew up his
skirts and passed the wounded man by.</p>

<h2><a name="LAZINESS" id="LAZINESS"></a>LAZINESS</h2>

<h3>We Are Becoming a Nation of Sitters</h3>


<p>Danger is in extremes. Too much of
anything is bad for the human being's
health.</p>

<p>There is a comfortable proportion of
exercise and rest mixed together that will
give bodily efficiency. Too much exercise
is bad, too little is bad.</p>

<p>Until recent years our vocations and the
going to or from our places of business gave
us a well balanced amount of exercise, rest,
work and pleasure, and all went well.</p>

<p>Lately we hear much about worry, neurasthenia,
nervous prostration and the like.
There are several contributing causes to the
mental and physical ills which are caused
by "nerves."</p>

<p>First of all, we have an epidemic of labor-saving
devices. The principal arguments
used by the manufacturer of a labor-saving
device is, "It makes money and saves
work." Making money and getting soft
snaps seem to be the objectives of most
human beings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The labor-saving devices take away exercise.
The machine does the work. The
artisan simply feeds the hopper, puts in a
new roll, or drops in the material. He sits
down and watches the wheels go around,
likely smoking a cigarette the meanwhile,
and more than likely reading the sporting
sheet of a yellow newspaper.</p>

<p>Possibly few of my readers have given
the matter serious thought, and they will
be astounded at the changed work conditions
which have come into our modern life.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to note just here
some of these changes. Men used to live
within walking distance of their work.
Now the electric street railway and the
speedy automobile have eliminated the
necessity for much walking.</p>

<p>Men used to climb stairs. The elevator
has now so accustomed us to the conveniences
that stairs are taboo.</p>

<p>Machines have replaced muscles. The
old printer walked from case to case and
got exercise. Today he sits in an easy
backed chair and uses a linotype.</p>

<p>Telephoning is quicker than traveling.
No one "runs for a doctor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Our houses have electric washers, electric
irons and many other labor-saving devices.</p>

<p>Even the farmer has his telephone, his
auto, his riding plow, his milking machine
and his cream separator.</p>

<p>In the stores the cash boy has disappeared,
the cash carrier takes the money
to a girl who sits, a machine makes the
change, another machine does her mathematics.</p>

<p>The modern idea of efficiency puts a
premium on the sedentary feature of occupations
and <ins class="mycorr" title="printed book has 'employes'">employees</ins> are frequently automatons
that sit.</p>

<p>The business man sits at his desk, sits
in a comfortable automobile as he goes
home, sits at the dinner table and sits all
evening at the theater, or at the card table.
It is sit, sit, sit until he gets a big abdomen,
a puffy skin and a bad liver.</p>

<p>He tries to counteract this with forced
exercise in a gymnasium or a couple of
hours golfing a week. Very likely his
golfing is more interesting because of the
side bets, than because of the exercise.</p>

<p>We are losing out on the natural, pleasurable,
and practical exercises, mixed in the
right proportions to promote physical poise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and health. Things are too easy, luxury and
comfort too teasing, for the ordinary mortal
to resist, and the great mob sits or rides
hundreds of times when they should stand
or walk.</p>

<p>When my objective point is five or six
blocks I walk and I think on the way. I
probably get in two to four miles of walking
every day, which my friends would save by
riding in the street cars or autos.</p>

<p>I walk to my office every morning, a distance
of nearly four miles.</p>

<p>I walk alone, so I may relax and not require
conscious effort as is the case when
one walks with another.</p>

<p>That morning walk prevents me reading
slush and worthless news and relieves me
of the necessity of talking and using up
nerve energy.</p>

<p>I get the worth-while news from my paper
by the headlines and by the trained ability
to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>I just feel fine all the time and it's because
I get to bed early, sleep plenty, exercise
naturally, think properly and get the four
great body-builders in plenty: air, water,
sunshine, food; and the other four great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
health-makers which are: good thought,
good exercise, good rest, and good cheer.</p>

<p>The great crowd aims at ease and so the
business man sits and loses out on the
exercise his body and mind must have, and
therefore the great crowd pays tribute to
doctors, sanitariums, rest cures, fake tonics,
worthless medicines, freakish diet fads, and
crazy cults, isms, and discoveries, that
claim to bring health by the easy, lazy,
sitting, comfortable route.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear reader, it is not in the
cards to play the game of health that way.
There "aint no sich animal" said the ruben
as he saw the giraffe in the circus, and likewise
there "aint no sich thing" as health
and happiness for the man who persistently
antagonizes nature, and hunts ease where
exercise is demanded.</p>

<p>The law of compensation is inexorable
in its demand that you have to pay for
what you get, and that you can't get
worth-while things by worthless plans.</p>

<p>You must exercise enough to balance
things, to clear the system, to preserve
your strength; it doesn't take much time.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_THE_BIG_WOODS" id="IN_THE_BIG_WOODS"></a>IN THE BIG WOODS</h2>

<h3>A Grand, Glorious, Restful
Recreation</h3>


<p>This afternoon I am sitting on a glacial
rock in the forest at the foot of Mount
Shasta. A beautiful spot to rest and a
glorious book of nature to read.</p>

<p>A canopy of deepest blue sky above, with
sunshine unstopped by clouds. The rays
of old Sol pulsate themselves into an endless
variety of flowers, plants and vegetable life
which Mother Earth has given birth to in
evidence of her gladness and love of the
beautiful.</p>

<p>Glorious trees of magnificent size reach
up into the blue and give us shade. Ozone
sweeps gently through the forest impregnated
with the perfume of fir, balsam,
cedar, pine and flowers.</p>

<p>In this spot, nature has thrown up mountains
of volcanic rock, which hold the
winter's snow in everlasting supply to
quench the thirst of plant, of animal and
millions of humans in the lower country.</p>

<p>The whole hillside around me is a community
of springs of crystal water laden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with iron, and precious salts. It is the
breast of Mother Earth which nurses her
offspring.</p>

<p>Here are no noises of the street; the newsboy's
cry of "extra" is not heard. The
peddler, the din of trucks, the honk of automobiles,
the clatter of the city&mdash;all these
are absent.</p>

<p>There is no noise here; just the sweet
music of falling water, and the aeolian
lullaby made by the breeze playing on the
pine needles.</p>

<p>My eyes take in a panorama of beautiful
nature in colors and contrasts that would
give stage fright to any artist who tried to
paint the scenes on canvas.</p>

<p>I am getting pep, this is my treatment
for tired nerves; 'tis the "medcin' of the
hills," 'tis nature's cure, and how it brings the
pill box or the bottle of tonic into contempt!</p>

<p>I'm letting down the high tension voltage
and getting the calm, natural pulsation that
nature intended the human machine to have.</p>

<p>So quiet, so peaceful, so natural that I
drink in inspiration of a worth-while kind.
No war news to read, no records of tragedy,
of man's passions, of man's meanness and
man's selfishness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>A little chipmunk sits upright on a rock
before me wondering at the movements of
my yellow pencil and the black mark it
makes on the paper.</p>

<p>A delicate lace-winged insect lights on
my tablet and a saucy "camp robber" or
mutton bird wonders at the unusual sight
of me, the big man animal brother. A big
beetle is getting his provisions for the winter.
I recognize his occupation, for I've
read about him in Fabre's wonderful books
on insect life.</p>

<p>Here in the sanctum sanctorium of the
forest I am made a member of Nature's
lodge, and the ants, and bugs, and beetles,
and flowers and plants and trees are initiating
me and telling me the secrets of the order.</p>

<p>I can only tell you who are in the great
busy world outside, the lessons and morals.
The real secrets I must not tell; you will
receive them when you, too, come to the
hills and forests, and sit down on a rock
alone and go through the initiation.</p>

<p>You are invited to come in; your application
is approved, and you are eligible to
membership.</p>

<p>Come to Nature's lodge meeting and
clear away the cobwebs from your weary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
brain; get inspiration and be a man again.</p>

<p>Come and soothe and rest and built up
those shredded, weakened, tired, weary
nerves. Let the sun put its coat of health
and the ozone put the red blood of strength
in your veins.</p>

<p>Come and get perfect brain and body-resting
sleep. Come to this wonderful,
happy, helpful lodge and get a store of
energy, and an abundance of vital ammunition
with which to make the fight, when
you go back to your factory or office.</p>

<p>The doctor can lance the carbuncle, but
Nature's outdoor medicine will prevent your
having a carbuncle.</p>

<p>The doctor can stop a pain with a poison
drug, but Nature's outdoor medicine will
prevent you having the disorder which
makes the pain.</p>

<p>No, brother, you can't get health out of
a bottle or a pill box. You can get it from
the Mother Nature's laboratory where she
compounds air, water, sunshine, beauty,
music, thought; where she gives you exercise
and rest, health, happiness, all summed up
into cashable assets for the human in the
shape of poise, efficiency, peace and that
spells PEP.</p>

<h3>The Most Unselfish Person in the
World</h3>


<p>Mother, you are the one person in all the
world whose kindness was never the preface
to a request.</p>

<p>That's the sweetest tribute we can pay
you, and the most truthful one.</p>

<p>It covers devotion, love, sentiment,
motherhood, and all the noble attributes
that go to make the word, Mother, the
most hallowed, most sacred, most beautiful
word in the English language.</p>

<p>There are not words or sentences that
can express to you what we think of you
or convey our appreciation of you.</p>

<p>You want our love; you have it. You
should be told of our love; we tell you.
Appreciation and gratitude are payments
on account, but with all our appreciation
and with our whole life's gratitude, the
debt we are under can never be paid.</p>

<p>We've hurt you, Mother, many times, by
our thoughtlessness and by our resentment
of your plans and your views about the
things we did, and you have had heartaches
because of such actions of ours.</p>

<p>Forgive us, Mother, we're sorry; and
there you are, dear; the moment we ask
your forgiveness, your great, tender, loving
heart has forgiven us and erased the marks
of transgression.</p>

<p>Always thinking of us, always excusing
us, always doing for us, always watching
us and always loving us in the most unselfish
way.</p>

<p>We love you, Mother; we appreciate you.
We are going to show our appreciation and
love so much more from now on. We have
just come to our senses and realized what
a wonderful, necessary, helpful being you
are.</p>

<p>Your sweetness, your gentleness, your
goodness, your love, are parts of you.</p>

<p>They all go to make up that word,
Mother.</p>

Motherhood, have all helped the world so
much more than you will ever know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

your name is in gold.</p>

<p>In the everlasting memory of those who
appreciate you, your face, your life, is the
sacred, helpful picture that grows more
beautiful as the days pass.</p>

<p>In tenderness, in appreciation, in love,
let us dedicate these thoughts, and voice
these expressions to Mother, who gives her
life, by inches, and who would give it all on
the instant for her children, if necessity
called for the sacrifice.</p>

<h2><a name="OUR_BODIES" id="OUR_BODIES"></a>OUR BODIES</h2>

<h3>They Are Made Up of Mineral
Substances</h3>


<p>We speak of the three kingdoms: the
animal, the vegetable and the mineral
kingdoms, and every substance is classified
into one of these.</p>

<p>The exact truth is there is but one kingdom,
which is the mineral. The vegetable
substances and animal combinations are
made of mineral elements.</p>

<p>In a rough way we distinguish the mineral
kingdom as those substances called elements,
such as iron, sulphur, carbon, oxygen,
hydrogen, sodium and the like.</p>

<p>These elements are unchangeable in themselves;
they do not grow. The animal is
made of mineral elements associated in
certain proportions, such as albumin, carbon,
lime, water, salt and the like. The
vegetable kingdom consists of these various
chemical combinations also.</p>

<p>Seed when planted extracts from the air
and the earth the minerals and combines
them into a plant which grows and has for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
its object the making of seeds to reproduce
and perpetuate itself.</p>

<p>The plant has life but it has no spiritual
or mental equipment and therein vegetable
life differs from the animal life. The
animal eats vegetable and animal flesh.
Through the vegetable he gets the mineral
necessary for his body building. Through
the animal food he gets the mineral from
the flesh he eats, which flesh was first of all
built up through the vegetables the animal
ate.</p>

<p>These are definite facts; there is no theory
about them.</p>

<p>The human body analyzed and separated
into something like a dozen substances,
among which are water, which is three-fourths
of the body's structure; carbon,
lime, phosphorus, iron, potassium, salt and
so on.</p>

<p>By reading a book on anatomy you can
learn just exactly the proportions of the
substances in the human body.</p>

<p>All these chemicals are formed in the
shape of little cells, myriads of which are
in the body. These cells are constantly
being destroyed and new ones made to take
their place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Parts of the body are replaced every
twenty-four hours, other parts less often.</p>

<p>Scientists tell us that the whole body is
replaced every seven years. Every move
you make destroys cells which nature has
to replace. Isn't it reasonable then to conclude
that if a man should fail to eat
enough lime for his body-building, his bones
would suffer. If he does not get enough
iron his blood will suffer, and so on.</p>

<p>I am definitely convinced that most of
the actual physical ailments are caused by
a deficiency of the mineral elements in the
body.</p>

<p>Phosphorus and potash are necessary to
the human welfare. These elements are in
the husk of the wheat and the husk is taken
off in making flour, and the flour is mostly
starch.</p>

<p>The person who lives mostly on white
bread will suffer from lack of phosphorus
and potash.</p>

<p>Phosphorus also is found in the skin of
an apple, so if you peel an apple you do
not get the phosphorus.</p>

<h2><a name="FOOD" id="FOOD"></a>FOOD</h2>

<h3>The Food We Eat Is Fuel for the
Human Engine</h3>


<p>The practice of medicine in the past has
been directed towards the curing of developed
disease and physical ailments. The
practice of medicine in the future is to be
along the line of preventive practice. Science
is showing us how to prevent infection.
Science is fighting the deadly microbe which
comes to us in the air we breathe, the water
we drink, and the food we eat and the
infected things we touch.</p>

<p>Nature has supplied the human body
with a home guard of necessary bacteria
and in the circulation system are phagocytes
which fight the invading microbes and generally
destroy them.</p>

<p>When the system is weakened through
disease, through lack of exercise or through
improper food, disease has an easy time.</p>

<p>The important thing to prevent disease
is to keep yourself fit, and the golden prescription
which I have given in PEP will
serve to keep you in perfect health.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>I want you to remember this golden prescription;
it is composed of the following:
Good Air, Good Water, Good Sunshine,
Good Food, Good Exercise, Good Cheer,
Good Rest and Good Thought. If you
take this golden prescription you will make
of yourself a giant in brain and brawn
strength.</p>

<p>You can't get health out of a bottle.
You can't get the system to absorb iron if
you take it in the form of tincture of iron.
You can eat a pound of rust, which is oxide
of iron, and none of that iron will be
absorbed in the system.</p>

<p>As I have explained in another chapter
you must take the mineral in the system
through the vegetable route. You will get
iron, that will be assimilated, when you
eat beefsteak. Beefsteak has blood, the
blood has iron. You will also get iron when
you eat spinach.</p>

<p>Every element necessary for your body
is found in some vegetable or animal food;
therefore, you should refrain from confining
yourself to a very few articles of food.</p>

<p>Don't pay any attention to the faddist
who gives you a rigorous diet or unpalatable
food. You simply make yourself miserable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and you generate more worry and unhappiness
by your discipline than the good you
get from these freak fads.</p>

<p>We all eat too much, especially too much
meat.</p>

<p>That a strict vegetarian diet is the necessary
thing for good health I deny. The
sheep, the cow, and horse are vegetarians
and they are short lived. The eagle, the
lion and man, eat animal food and they
are long lived.</p>

<p>I may be prejudiced, but it does seem to
me that the strict vegetarians are skinny,
sallow looking lot of humans, speaking
generally. I do find that the healthier
specimens of vegetarians are those who eat
plenty of eggs and drink plenty of milk,
both of which are animal food, and both of
which have nearly all the elements necessary
to sustain life.</p>

<p>I don't like the fads in the matter of
eating. The amount a person should eat
is in exact accord with the law of compensation.</p>

<p>The human body is a machine from a
food standpoint. It is an engine that has
work to do and accordingly the amount of
fuel necessary for the engine should be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
proportion to the amount of work that
engine is called on to perform.</p>

<p>The hotels, restaurants and food purveyors
invent palate tickling food to tease
the human to eat, and hotels and restaurants
are mostly patronized by people
who do not have much physical work to do;
the consequence is they eat too much.</p>

<p>You do not often find dyspepsia or
indigestion among men or women who work
hard physically.</p>

<p>You who work indoors with little physical
exercise will find wonderful benefits if you
will cut down the fuel.</p>

<p>You will get sick if you pile in more fuel
than is necessary for the engine.</p>

<p>If your engine needs twenty pounds of
steam how foolish it is to keep up a hundred
pounds pressure.</p>

<p>If you had five-horsepower work to perform
how foolish it would be to install a
two-hundred-and-fifty-pound engine.</p>

<p>Much of the physical trouble comes from
filling up the boiler too much.</p>

<p>Cut down the food and you will feel
better.</p>

<h2><a name="DAUGHTERS" id="DAUGHTERS"></a>DAUGHTERS</h2>

<h3>A Message From a Daddy's Heart</h3>


<p>Dear little Mary Elizabeth and Nancy
Lou and dear little girls everywhere who
read these lines: here is a message and a
wish from daddy's heart.</p>

<p>I want you to be golden girls, girls who
love home and children; girls who love
simple things, natural things; I want you
to be sweet rather than pretty, lovable
rather than popular.</p>

<p>May the mirror never reflect paint, rouge
or make-up on your face. A little talcum
powder is all right.</p>

<p>Do not look upon matrimony as a means
to provide food and finery for you.</p>

<p>Do not be ashamed of an old-fashioned
mother. Do not be a "good fellow." Do
not be afraid to say "I can't afford it."</p>

<p>Help the family; be part of it, and not
apart from it.</p>

<p>When you are old enough to have a beau,
do not be afraid to bring him into your
home, no matter how humble it is.</p>

<p>When I was a beau I courted my sweetheart
in her home. My treat was red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
apples and a walk down the lane. Most
every beau nowadays courts his girl with
a taxi to the theatre, and red lobsters after
the dinner; ten dollars they pay where I
paid ten cents, and I had ten times more
happiness.</p>

<p>Be modest, girls; it is your greatest asset.</p>

<p>Don't gossip or belittle other girls; find
the good you can say of others; that quality
makes you more attractive.</p>

<p>Keep your voice low, be gentle, sweet,
kind, human and simple; that is what my
sweetheart is; that is why our married life
has been a honeymoon all these years.</p>

<p>Watch out for word candy and flattery;
these things mark the hypocrite and a
hypocrite is an abomination. Flattery is a
practiced deceit&mdash;a dishonorable bait to
catch affections.</p>

<p>Do not allow any young man to relate a
story in your presence that has the slightest
risque turn to it. Show by your words and
your actions that such presumption is an
insult.</p>

<p>Fine feathers never make fine birds;
don't borrow finery; don't be attractive for
your fine dresses; the men attracted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
fluff, frills, feathers and furbelows are not
worth shucks.</p>

<p>Be square with yourself and square to
the man who is after your heart; put yourself
mentally in the place of a wife, when a
man gets serious.</p>

<p>Don't hurry, girls; don't judge the man
by his money prospects but by his character
and ambition.</p>

<p>Have nothing to do with any young
suitor who isn't always kind, considerate
and attentive to his mother.</p>

<p>Marry a man of character who courts
you in the sweet, simple old way.</p>

<p>If a young man spends money extravagantly
before marriage, hard times will
always be around during his married life.</p>

<p>The most precious possessions in the
world are happiness and love, and these;
come from simple things, genuineness, and
usefulness.</p>

<p>Learn to cook and to sew. You can't be
happy and idle at the same time.</p>

<p>Learn to be independent of dressmaker
and milliner and cooks. You may have
them, I hope you will, but master these
useful vocations yourself, then you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
have dresses and hats and dinners worth
while.</p>

<p>The world is full of new-fashioned slangy,
dancy, fancy, foolish girls who marry for
style, stunts and society, and their married
life is failure, worry and sorrow.</p>

<p>Be the golden, pure, old-fashioned, sweet,
simple, quiet, modest girl who knows things,
rather than one who is a show-off girl.</p>

<p>And here's a tip to you, young man, who
reads these lines, get a golden girl like I
have described; a girl of pure gold and not
glittering tinsel; a sweet, natural, sensible
girl, that will do team work and be a helpmate
to you and not a drawback and
money spender.</p>

<p>Daddy knows these things; he's been
around the world. He is endowed with an
ability to observe, analyze and benefit.</p>

<p>He's had experience, he's seen the world
from cottage to castle, and these things he
tells you because of his love for you and
because he wants you to have such a home
life as he has.</p>

<p>And these truths, these hopes, are from
the very bottom of his heart to his daughters
Mary Elizabeth and Nancy Lou and all
the other girls who have read these lines.</p>

<p>These men progress with confidence in
their hearts and smiles on their faces. They
do not lie in wait for the band wagon or
favorable winds; they make things happen.</p>

<p>They are, of course, alert and alive to
favorable opportunity and helpful influences
when they come their way.</p>

<p>These men are men of good health. They
are out of doors much, they carry their
heads high and breathe in good air deeply.
They greet friends with a smile and put
meaning and feeling into every hand clasp.</p>

<p>Let's you and I follow their trail, for it
leads out on to the big road.</p>

<p>Do not fear being misunderstood, right
will finally come in to its own.</p>

<p>We will keep our minds off our enemies,
and keep our thoughts on our purpose; we
will make up our minds what we want to
do. We will mark a straight line on the
log and hew to that line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Fear is the dope drug that kills initiative,
hate the poison that shatters clear thinking.</p>

<p>Hate and fear are iron ore in our life's
vessel, it deflects the compass and prevents
our holding to the course.</p>

<p>There are splendid worth-while things for
us to do and with continuity of action and
singleness of purpose the days will pass by,
as we are seizing opportunity and making
use of the things required for the fulfillment
of our desires.</p>

<p>We are like the coral insect that takes
from the running tide the material to build
a solid fortress. Our running tide is the
gliding golden days.</p>

<p>Let's waste no time in trying to make
friends or in seeking to attach ourselves to
others. True friends are not caught by
pursuit; they come to us, they happen
through circumstances we do not create.</p>

<p>Self-reliance is ours and we must first use
it for our own betterment. We will then
have a surplus of energy to allow us to
help others.</p>

<p>Solitude beats society, relaxation beats
conventional function, and foolish so-called
pleasures.</p>

<p>Our energy hours must be devoted to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
purpose and ideals. Atween times we
must rest, relax and recuperate the waste
that strenuosity makes.</p>

<p>Breathe good air, bask in the sunshine,
see nature and say to yourself, "All these
treasures are for me, all these things I am
part of."</p>

<p>Do not prepare for death, prepare for
life. Preparing for death brings the end
before your allotted time.</p>

<p>Like Job of old that which we fear will
come to us. We must not think of death,
or waste time preparing for it. It makes
us miserable today. It makes us weak and
fills us with fear and it draws the day of
our departure nearer.</p>

<p>Today is ours. Live, freely, fully today.
Be unafraid, unhurried, and undisturbed.</p>

<p>We are building character, and the way
we build it is by mental attitude, by our
acts, and the way we employ the precious
time today.</p>

<p>Lay hold of the great forces of nature,
realize the wonderful power of the will and
you will be strong, a veritable king among
men.</p>

<h2><a name="PIONEER_MOTHERS" id="PIONEER_MOTHERS"></a>PIONEER MOTHERS</h2>

<h3>Knitting From Necessity Today,
Knitting for Pleasure Tomorrow</h3>


<p>As I write these lines I am riding on a
slow train through Oklahoma. Purposely I
am in the day coach smoker for that's the
place to study local color, and see the
natives.</p>

<p>The atmosphere around is oil and gas,
the talk is "bringing in a gusher," "tanks,"
"rigs," "leases," "wild cat sales," "off-*sets,"
"selling stock," and the like; all the
phrases, all the talk is striking it rich, getting
money.</p>

<p>Indians, Mexicans, Negroes, college boys
in surveying crews and speculators form a
hodge podge. Men from all parts of the
states are here seeking dollars.</p>

<p>I have been around these oil and gas
fields in autos and by teams. I've been
observing life, character, passions and
habits.</p>

<p>I've seen brave women here with nursing
babies living in tents or patchwork shacks.
Some of these women dream at night of
silks and satins and mansions and position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>By day these poor women work and mend
and cook and sew, doing their part to help
things along. Many of the husbands are
earning five to eight dollars a day and
spending most of it on foolishness. The
poor wives get only enough for bare necessities,
and yet they patiently work and
mend and cook and sew.</p>

<p>Talk about patience; talk about devotion;
talk about grit; talk about courage; just
come down to the oil fields and see these
poor pioneer women.</p>

<p>Talk about selfishness; talk about cowardice;
talk about brutality; talk about
debasement; come down and see some of
these men making $25 to $50 a week and
never a cent in their pockets Monday
morning.</p>

<p>Woman is called weak&mdash;that means the
rich woman&mdash;the poor woman possesses
strength that psychology cannot explain.
Men can be analyzed, but you are at a loss
to understand woman. Poor women grow
into a sweet replica of their mothers, the
most unselfish, patient, generous, forgiving,
lovable, adorable creatures on earth.</p>

<p>Man grows away from his mother; he
roughens and cools and grows selfish and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
expects and demands the woman shall love
him with all these faults, and generally she
does.</p>

<p>The poor woman makes an idol of her
husband and in her love thinks he is ideal.</p>

<p>Let him spend his money, she sticks to
him; let poverty and want come to the
home, she sticks. Let ill treatment be her
portion, she sticks; and withal there are
smiles on her lips most of the time.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the poor woman in the oil
fields, and the only glimmer of compensation
I can find is that she doesn't have nervous
prostration like her wealthy society sister
has.</p>

<p>Those little husky children I see over
there in the yard playing Indian will likely
know the worth of a dollar later on. I
peep into the future and predict that those
boys will get on in the world, and Mother
who is chopping wood for supper I see some
day with a nice black grosgrain silk dress
and a ball of knitting in her silk hand bag.</p>

<p>I see her from necessity knitting stockings
for her children. In the future
some day, far beyond want, for her sons
will be successful men, she still is knitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and mending and helping, a smile on her
lips and a soft light in her eye.</p>

<p>Plump, round and well fed, she sits there
knitting with pleasure and dreaming of the
pioneer days she spent in the Oklahoma
cabin. Yes, that's the picture of the future.</p>

<p>The train is pulling into a city; I don't
want the picture of the poor, hard-working,
unselfish, sacrificing woman and her worthless
husband to remain in my memory.</p>

<p>The sons will come out all right; they
always do when they have a shiftless dad
and a good mother. And somehow in this
great open splendid Western country there
is opportunity for such boys.</p>

<p>The big men here were all poor a short
time ago. Their grandfathers were rich,
their fathers spent their inheritance, they
suffered poverty and want and their extremity
was the son's spur to ambitious
activity.</p>

<p>In the car are four young sports coming
home from college on a vacation. Their
daddies are all oil kings, and these youngsters
will inherit fortunes.</p>

<p>Those youngsters who were playing
Indian will get on in the world; these four
young millionaire kids will go broke; their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
heads are not shaped right; their jaws slant
back; it isn't in them. I know something
of character.</p>

<p>Bye-bye, Mamma, with your little cabin
and your boys; some day you will have
peace and plenty.</p>

<p>Those four oil Johnnies will marry girls
who have plenty and some day those girls
will have to do the family washing.</p>

<p>The wheel turns, it's the history of the
past. From shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in
three generations.</p>

<p>Lincolns, Garfields, and Edisons came
from just such little cabins and just such
rough, hard, bare life as I have been seeing
this afternoon.</p>

<h2><a name="ANGER" id="ANGER"></a>ANGER</h2>

<h3>It's a Temporary Mental
Derangement</h3>


<p>Anger and acts of revenge are great pull-backs
to health.</p>

<p>Anger makes the blood rush to the head,
weakens the body, and distorts the vision.</p>

<p>When a woman gets angry, she quarrels
with her lover, her husband or her children.
Any one of these things is a calamity.</p>

<p>When a man gets angry he is a wild man,
his eyes glitter, his mouth is cruel, his fists
clinch, his body trembles, his blood veins
strain and he does more harm in five
minutes' anger than nature can repair in a
day.</p>

<p>Anger makes weak stomachs, dizzy heads,
poor judgment, lost friends, despair, sickness
and likely the confirmed habit will lead
to apoplexy.</p>

<p>When two men have differences, watch
the cool man finish victor, the angry man
always loses.</p>

<p>Keep your head; let the other fellow fret
and fume.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>He will tie himself up in a knot and finish
loser.</p>

<p>Serenity is a God's blessing and fortunate
is the man who can hold his serenity.</p>

<p>When you get a letter that stirs you to
anger, don't answer that letter for forty-eight
hours, then write a moderately vitriolic
letter,&mdash;and then tear it up.</p>

<p>I know you are tempted, goaded and your
limit of endurance is sometimes exhausted.</p>

<p>I know revenge is sweet only in anticipation.
I know that revenge by anger and
by the cruel "eye for an eye" measure is
never, never sweet.</p>

<p>I have had imposition, ingratitude, insincerity
and advantages taken of me because
I kept my poise and serenity.</p>

<p>I have been called easy, and soft, and
friends have shown me where I was imposed
upon, but I was stooping to conquer. I
kept my reserve, my resistance and my
power ready until time, place, and preparedness
let me spring my coup and then
I cashed in beautifully in principal and
interest for those acts and hurts.</p>

<p>I have power now in my hands to make
others suffer, keenly and deeply, for wrongs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
they have done me. Yet I do not exercise
that power to revenge.</p>

<p>I have been misjudged and misunderstood
because cowardly persons have lied and
villified me and accused me of motives and
acts of which I was innocent.</p>

<p>I am well hated now by one person in
particular who blames me for things another
is guilty of. A word from me would clear
me, but it would bring gloom and despair
to that person and would not make me any
less cognizant of my innocence.</p>

<p>Time somehow will bring out the truth;
the cowardly, guilty individual who basks
in the favor of the one who is angry at me
will surely pay for his wrong.</p>

<p>This I know and I am satisfied with the
ultimate result.</p>

<p>My former friend who is angry at me
would simply switch the anger current to
the guilty one if I told the facts; the guilty
person couldn't stand that anger like I can.
My act would break up a home and bring
misery.</p>

<p>I am far removed from the location
where these people live, and I can stand
the anger of the one who puts the blame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
on me and accepts the lies of another as
truth.</p>

<p>I have the documents in black and white,
yet I don't use them because I have poise
and the consciousness of knowing I am
right and those who are dear to me know
it, too.</p>

<p>I could be angry, but I couldn't live and
enjoy and write books like "Pep" and this
book if I let anger get in and spoil the
serenity which is mine.</p>

<p>I've tried both plans, anger and poise,
and I like poise better.</p>

<p>I believe I hear more birds, I believe I
get more pleasure out of life and living
than the man who gets angry and loves
revenge.</p>

<p>Anyway I think so, and "As a man
thinketh in his heart, so is he."</p>

<h2><a name="SALT" id="SALT"></a>SALT</h2>

<h3>It's a Drug; Too Much Is Bad for
You</h3>


<p>Don't eat too much salt. Salt is a drug;
it carries with it lime and magnesia and
they tend to clog up things.</p>

<p>Too much salt will likely cause gall
stones or gravel.</p>

<p>Some persons sprinkle salt over potatoes,
beef and everything they eat; it's a bad
practice.</p>

<p>You get enough salt in your bacon, and
in the meat you eat. The food as it comes
from the kitchen has plenty of salt in it.</p>

<p>Those who eat too much salt must suffer.</p>

<p>People have told me that the craving for
salt was a natural thing; it isn't so, it's a
cultivated taste. You didn't like salty
olives the first time you tasted them.</p>

<p>Because deer and cattle greedily lick salt
is no proof salt is natural and good, and
needed in quantities. Cattle and horses
will eat loco weed and when they get the
habit they will eat and eat until they get
crazy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Man will crave tobacco; it isn't a natural
taste, it's merely a cultivated taste.</p>

<p>The desire for excess salt on everything
you eat is a habit and a bad habit.</p>

<p>It tends to make calcareous deposits in
your system, and it will affect the blood
and the muscles and the bones.</p>

<p>Nature puts practically enough salt in
the food and cooks certainly add enough
salt in their seasoning to furnish all the
system needs.</p>

<p>Excess salt eating dulls the finer sensibilities
of taste just as excess pepper or
Worcester sauce or mustard does. It kills
the fine natural flavor.</p>

<p>There's enough salt in butter to season
the eggs you eat. Try your eggs next time
without putting pepper and salt on them.</p>

<p>Learn to get the natural flavors and you
will enjoy your food more.</p>

<p>Remember again excess craving for salt
is simply evidence that you have a drug
habit, not as dangerous as other drug habits,
but bad for you just the same.</p>

<p>Check yourself every time you reach
for a salt cellar.</p>

<p>Watch the children; don't let them eat
too much salt.</p>

<h2><a name="INSOMNIA" id="INSOMNIA"></a>INSOMNIA</h2>

<h3>It's Caused By High Mental Tension</h3>


<p>Sleeping, like breathing and digesting, is
controlled by the subconscious brain centers.
Natural sleep requires no positive mental
impulse; it's just relaxing and nature takes
care of the process.</p>

<p>That is natural sleep, but when you start
your dry cell battery, the brain, and commence
to worry and fear, you are going to
stay awake; then the conscious mind dominates
the subconscious mind and you banish
the very comforter you seek to woo.</p>

<p>Business men who keep up high tension
all day on business matters, and high tension
all evening in threshing all over again
the business of the day, are almost sure to
suffer from insomnia.</p>

<p>The continuance of the day and night
habit of thinking of business brings on the
insomnia habit and that starts the auto
suggestion that you are fighting for your
natural sleep. This produces worry, the
demon that kills and maims.</p>

<p>To have an occasional wakeful night is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
natural; it is an evidence of intelligence:
the mental dullard never has wakeful
nights.</p>

<p>Unless the fear of sleeplessness becomes
a full grown phobia no anxiety need be felt.
The fear of insomnia, the over anxiety to
go to sleep, is to be more dreaded than
insomnia itself.</p>

<p>To get refreshing sleep you must get
physical tiredness. Take exercise. Walk
in one direction until the first symptoms
of becoming tired appears, then walk home.
Take a hot bath, then sponge with cold or
cool water. Put a cold cloth at the head,
rub the backbone with cold water.</p>

<p>Open your windows wide, then relax.
Don't worry; you are going to sleep.</p>

<p>Lie on your back, open your eyes wide,
look up as if you were trying to see your
eyebrows, hold your eyes open this way
ten to twenty seconds, then close them
slowly. Repeat this several times. Soon
the sandman will come.</p>

<p>Concentrate your mind on auto suggestion
like this: "I am going to sleep&mdash;sound
heavy, restful, peaceful sleep. My eyelids
are getting heavy&mdash;heavy. I am going to
close them and go to sleep."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Don't try counting imaginary sheep jumping
over fence rails. Don't count numbers.
It is a bad habit.</p>

<p>If these suggestions do not help you the
first night say, "All right, my brain was too
active, so then tomorrow I will let down
a bit."</p>

<p>Next night eat one or two dry crackers,
chew them slowly, masticate them thoroughly
until you can swallow easily.</p>

<p>This little food will draw the blood
pressure from the brain and help you to go
to sleep.</p>

<p>Drive out business and worry thoughts.
Think faith and courage thoughts.</p>

<h2><a name="MISTAKES" id="MISTAKES"></a>MISTAKES</h2>

<h3>Not the Making But the Repeating,
Is Your Danger</h3>


<p>To live down the past and erase the
errors, live boldly the present.</p>

<p>Do not chastise or condemn yourself for
mistakes you have made; you are not
alone; everyone has made missteps, has
hurt others, has wronged himself.</p>

<p>Everyone has had trouble, reverses and
misfortune; it's the plan of things, and
these things come to give us experience and
correct our future acts by the knowledge of
how to avoid errors and wrongs.</p>

<p>Yesterday is dead; forget it. Face about;
live today; be busy, be active, be intent on
doing right and accomplishing things worth
while.</p>

<p>The world's memory is short. A misdeed,
an error, a wrongful act on your part
may set busy tongues wagging today and
you may suffer from calumny and criticism.
Of course your errors will be magnified and
your wrongs enlarged beyond the truth;
that's the penalty you pay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Lies are always added to truth in telling
of one's misdeeds. Be brave; weather the
storm, it will soon blow over. Tomorrow
the world will forget.</p>

<p>You've suffered in your own conscience;
that's all the debt you can pay on the old
score.</p>

<p>Now, then, get busy with the glorious
opportunity today presents. Don't make
the same mistake again. There are no
eyes in the back of your head; look forward.</p>

<p>Don't worry by envying the other fellow
and comparing his good deeds with your
mistakes; you only see his good. He has
had troubles and made mistakes too, but
you and the world have forgotten them.</p>

<p>If every man's sins were printed on their
foreheads the crowds you pass would all
wear their hats over their eyes.</p>

<p>I'm trying to comfort you, and slap you
on the back and tell you you are just
human and all humans make false steps.</p>

<p>The patriarchs in the Bible made mistakes,
but they got in the fold. History has
perpetuated their names. Their lives on
the whole were worth while. It's the sum
total of acts that count.</p>

<h2><a name="TOMORROW" id="TOMORROW"></a>TOMORROW</h2>

<h3>A Little Analysis of Our Relation to
Eternity</h3>


<p>One man says the present is everything,
the eternity is nothing.</p>

<p>The other man says eternity is everything,
present is nothing.</p>

<p>I believe the real truth is, both are man's
chief concern, and neither is all truth.</p>

<p>In this matter the general rule I have so
often pointed out will harmoniously apply;
that rule is, avoid extremes.</p>

<p>Those who believe that the now, the
present, is the all important thing in man's
life have the fashionable or favorite point
of view.</p>

<p>Man definitely knows much about the
present, he knows much about life. He is
in the midst of life&mdash;it pulsates all around
him and in him.</p>

<p>We know positively that the law of
compensation is inexorable in its demands
for right and positive in its punishment of
wrong.</p>

<p>We know that on this earth kindness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
love, occupation, help, truth, honor and
sympathy are investments which bring
happiness today. You get your pay instantly
when you have done a helpful act
and you get your punishment instantly
when you have done a hurtful act.</p>

<p>That there is a future most of us agree,
because good sense and logic points to that
sane and reasonable conclusion.</p>

<p>So be it, with a belief in the future estate,
it is reasonable to assume that our acts
and lives in the present estate will have
influence on our future estate.</p>

<p>We know positively of today, and the
happiness we can get from good deeds done
today.</p>

<p>If we will have power in the future to
look back to today's acts, well and good, if
today's acts are worth while.</p>

<p>The other view that eternity is everything
and the present is nothing is the
antiquated view, the narrow view; the, I
might say, illiterate view.</p>

<p>That view warps the present life; it calls
for present self-chastisement, present gloom,
present sorrow and present misery.</p>

<p>It takes the tangible definite today, calls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
it nothing, and accepts the intangible unknown
eternity as everything.</p>

<p>It trades the definite for the indefinite.
It calls life a bubble, a vapor, a shadow.
In fact, it makes gloom on today's sunshine
and puts its believers into a purgatory;
a dismal unhappy punishment antechamber
where man exists and waits peeping out of
his cell windows for a little imagined view
of eternity.</p>

<p>He waits and endures the unpleasant
interval, steeled against definite pleasures
and evident life of today, and worried into
an intoxicated colored belief in the expected
happiness of the undefined future.</p>

<p>He refuses to think of definite life of
today and spoils the thought of those who
do.</p>

<p>He is a blockade to progress, a disagreeable
part of life's picture.</p>

<p>He gets no happiness in the today which
is in his hands, he loses this opportunity
during his definite existence, and lives on
future hopes in a future state which no
man today knows what it will be.</p>

<p>Both theories as ultimate beliefs are
wrong, yet each has some truth in its conclusion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>By taking the words eternity and present
and saying both means everything, we
avoid extremes and form a truth that is
rational, and harmonious to good reason.</p>

<p>The man who says present is all does so
because he is an utilitarian. He acts on the
definite and refuses to believe in the abstract.
Anything that is outside the sphere
of his vision and action is of little concern
to him.</p>

<p>The man who says eternity is all, wastes
opportunity, example and warps himself
into a miserable hermit.</p>

<p>Life is irrevocable. Every act in our life
is placed, set, and fixed.</p>

<p>Every act goes in the record book of
yesterday and it cannot be changed.</p>

<p>Acts that hurt others will rebound and
hurt us. Deeds that helped others will rebound
and help us. This much is certain.</p>

<p>There is a future, I believe that. There
is a God, I believe that.</p>

<p>Just what the future is, and just what
God is, I do not know in perfect detail.</p>

<p>Reward for good and punishment for
bad, is part of God's plan, and I am conscious
of this truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>I know that justice prevails in this life,
and this life is what I am living now.</p>

<p>If I live and act today in what I sincerely
believe is in tune with God's purpose, I
shall in my future estate benefit by those
acts.</p>

<p>If I live and act today, disregarding all
around me, selfishly catering to personal
purpose, believing that eternity is everything
and present is nothing, I am passing
definite opportunity to do good now, for
a hope of personal reward in an eternity,
the which is indefinite as to what it shall be.</p>

<p>I shall therefore strive to do, and to be,
right; to be kind, helpful, cheery and smiling
now, for the reward such acts bring now.</p>

<p>And I shall doubtless have as good a
record and passport to the future as the
man who suffers now and lives only upon
his selfish hope of the future.</p>

<p>His is fear thought, mine is faith thought,
in the all wise, all powerful, all seeing, all
right Ruler of the universe, who gave me
my life, my brain, my reason, which I am
trying to use, as nearly as my limitations
will allow, to helping myself and helping
others to smile, to be happy, to be serene,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to be confident, to be competent, to be
useful.</p>

<p>This is as I see it. I wouldn't do what
I do, think what I think or act as I act unless
I were sincere.</p>

<p>Below all this is charity, which means
you have the unquestioned right to do and
to be what your best thought and conscience
tells you to do and to be.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is well to reason with one
another on the subject of the now and the
tomorrow of our existence for it is a universal
subject on which all men must
make a decision.</p>

<p>"I believe in him because he is so sincere."</p>

of her salvation.</p>

<p>The Christian Scientist is sincere in the
belief that medicines do not cure diseases.
The doctor is equally sincere that medicines
will cure disease.</p>

<p>The Theosophist is sincere, the Atheist,
the Agnostic, the Christian, the Pagan, the
Mohammedan, the Buddhist, the Sun-worshipper,
the Republican, the Democrat,
the Progressive, the Prohibitionist, the
Brewer, all these are sincere in their beliefs.
And as these beliefs are different, it is
common sense to say that no one creed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
sect, belief, branch, dogma or system, is all
truth.</p>

<p>It is true every channel or avenue we
meet in life's travel has some truth, but it <ins class="mycorr"
title="printed book has 'is is'">is</ins>
not for you or me to assume that we are
the sole possessors of wisdom and the real
discoverers of all truth.</p>

<p>We must not take the conclusions we
arrive at and expect to force the world to
accept without protest our rules for conduct,
our methods for living, our practices
for morals, or our beliefs, for their guide.</p>

<p>Converts to new doctrines, new issues,
new cults and to the old ones, too, are made
largely because the ambassadors or proselyters
seem so fervid and sincere in expounding
what they claim is the definite truth.</p>

<p>The believers in a cult or code of ethics
are auto <ins class="mycorr" title="printed book has 'hypnotnized'">hypnotized</ins>, their visions are
narrowed.</p>

<p>By focusing their thought on their special
belief they bring together sophistry, arguments,
examples and so-called proof that
gives them facility in arguing the case or
expounding their doctrine.</p>

<p>You can make no gain to try to argue
with a Christian Scientist. You ask for
concrete rules, definite answers and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
proofs than their flat statements, and you
are told you have not the understanding,
that your attitude is not in the right plane,
and that the truth cannot be shown you.</p>

<p>You are told to have faith, belief, to
eliminate antagonism, and to study "Science
and Health" and you will receive the divine
spirit and see the light.</p>

<p>The Scientist is sincere; he shows you
"Science and Health" with a lot of testimonials
in the back to prove that Christian
Science cures disease. Every patent medicine,
every science, every system of healing
has testimonials by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Scientists say there is no disease, no
material, that we are only spirit or soul, or
thought; that we are not matter but mind.
That health is truth and disease is error.
They deny disease yet "Science and Health"
and the midweek experience meetings have
testimonials of disease cured by Christian
Science.</p>

<p>There is much truth in Christian Science.
People are helped by it, people are sincere
in their belief in it, but that Christian
Science is all truth, all powerful, all right,
all sufficient, cannot be proven.</p>

<p>What about the people who have gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
hence before Christian Science was ever
heard of?</p>

<p>The theological religion today, the practices
and beliefs, differ from the vogue of
fifty years ago.</p>

<p>If the Protestant religion be all truth
what became of our religious ancestors who
died before Martin Luther found the truth?</p>

<p>I have no quarrel with the Christian
Scientist, the Protestant, the Roman Catholic,
the Buddhist, or the Mohammedan. I
must be generous and broad enough to say
others have the right to think and be
sincere. All sciences have truth, but no
science, sect, cult, dogma, or creed is ALL
truth.</p>

<p>Sincerity may be satisfaction and necessary
for the possessors of that sincerity,
but that your sincerity in your belief must
be accepted by me as proof that I should
believe as you do, is, I believe, the place
where I have the undoubted right to say,
"I reserve the right to my own conclusions
and I am unjust to myself if I force myself
to accept your viewpoint without full belief
myself that you are right."</p>

<p>So, then, because a person is sincere in a
belief that is contrary to your conscientious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
belief, do not be disturbed or swerved from
common sense analysis or convinced against
your better judgment.</p>

<p>No one possesses all the truth. It is for
you and me to do our plain duty as we see
it, to do the best we can each day in act
and thought and word.</p>

<p>We can pretty much agree on the simple
essential truths which are proven. That
is, being honest, truthful, kind, lovable,
sympathetic, cheerful, doing good, helping
one another and doing things worth while.</p>

<p>If we agree on these things and do useful
work and think helpful thoughts, we are
doing our duty.</p>

<p>Theories, arguments and studying too
deeply on bootless systems, codes, beliefs,
cults, isms, or doctrines, is a waste of time.</p>

<p>When we can here and now derive
definite benefits from doing the simple and
helpful things and acting and thinking the
simple practical cheer thoughts, it is not
necessary or good for us to waste time on
spiritualism or theoretical beliefs that cannot
be proved to our own selves satisfactorily.</p>

<p>We are asked to believe these strange,
impractical, unnatural beliefs, because of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the sincerity of others. It's better to do,
and to be the thing we can ourselves
measure, understand and sincerely believe.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of strange beliefs and
spiritual systems, each claiming to be all
powerful, all right. If any one is all truth
then all the others are all wrong.</p>

<p>The bigot who assumes he is the sole
possessor of truth, the cult, sect, ism, or
science that claims to possess all truth, and
the exact rules for the world to obey, should
be classed with those other misguided men
and religions which burned human beings
who dared to doubt their right to the
possession of all truth.</p>

<p>God never gave his approval to any one
man-made religious sect.</p>

<p>God is the universal good power; man
often tries to interpret God's idea to his
own selfish narrow vision.</p>

<h2><a name="PILLS" id="PILLS"></a>PILLS</h2>

<h3>The Man Who Has a Pill for Every Ill</h3>


<p>How often we see the pill fiend. In his
vest pocket he has a small apothecary
shop, a collection of round paste-board
boxes and little bottles.</p>

<p>Every little while he dopes himself. If
his stomach is on a strike he pops in a pill.
If his head aches he takes a tablet. If he
sneezes he takes a cold cure pill.</p>

<p>When anyone around speaks of a pain or
ache he hands the person a pill.</p>

<p>The pill eater is a hypochondriac and
very likely his doctor knows it. The salvation
is that the doctor probably gives him
harmless stuff in pill form. The patient
doesn't know this and it's like a rabbit's
foot or a piece of pork rubbed on a wart;
it satisfies the mind and nature makes the
cure.</p>

<p>Often, however, the pills are not innocent;
the pill fiend buys the tablets and pills
direct from the druggist. The headache
tablet is most likely one of the coal tar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
drugs like acetanilid, and that is positively
harmful when taken too often.</p>

<p>There are times to take pills, in cases of
emergency, when you can shock nature
with a poison and bring a wholesome
reaction.</p>

<p>These times are rare, and the doctor
should be the sole judge as to when they
are necessary.</p>

<p>Exercise, diet, correct habits of living
will prevent congestion and illness that
cause pain.</p>

<p>The pill habit is nothing less than a drug
habit, and the drug habit positively weakens
the system.</p>

<p>The headache tablet does not cure the
headache, it only stops the pain; the evil is
still there. The headache is merely nature's
signal that something is out of whack.</p>

<p>Headaches are generally caused by the
stomach, eye strain, or neuralgia; the latter
in turn is caused by too much uric acid in
the system.</p>

<p>Eat fruit, drink plenty of water, and that
will flush the system and stop stomachic
headache.</p>

<p>See the optician if it's eyes. If you have
frequent headache in the forehead, very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
likely it's the eyes, even though you do not
suspect it.</p>

<p>If it's neuralgia, get a corrective diet list
from the doctor.</p>

<p>I know scores of men and women, too,
who take pills enough to kill a person.
Their systems have been educated up to it;
they are saturated with poison.</p>

<p>And the worst of it is they never get well
while taking the pills; it is only a temporary
deadening of the pain.</p>

<p>Then there are many who take pills to
make them sleep. That's a crime. It's
murder in slow degrees for they are surely
shortening their lives by this poison dope
pill habit.</p>

<p>Mark this: Nature, and Nature alone,
effects cures and it's in very, very few
instances that a poison pill can be used to
advantage.</p>

<p>You can keep well by getting good air,
good water, good sunshine, good food, good
exercise, good rest, good cheer and good
thought. That is what I call my golden
prescription, and it will do wonders for
you, and every doctor will tell you so.</p>

<p>Pills kill, if you keep up the habit. There
are no two ways about it. I say positively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and knowingly, that this pill habit is absolutely
life shortening.</p>

<p>Don't try to argue; the evidence is unshakable
on this point.</p>

<p>If you had seen the derelicts in the
hospitals I have seen, if you had seen the
wretched bodies, destroyed nerve systems,
the drugged, shattered, hopeless patients
resulting from the baneful pill habit, you
would be as positive as I am in saying pills
kill if you keep up the habit.</p>

<p>Life is sweet and precious to us all. Do
not shorten it by taking pills and tablets
for every ache or pain. Try nature's way.
Realize that mental suggestion and will
power will drive away most pains or temporary
aches.</p>

<p>Brace up, cheer up; chuck the pills in
the garbage can.</p>

<h2><a name="FAKE_MEDICINES" id="FAKE_MEDICINES"></a>FAKE MEDICINES</h2>

<h3>Like Whiskey, the End Is Near</h3>


<p>Whiskey must go. It is written on the
pages of the records of man's progress.
Likewise must the quack doctor and the
fake medicine go.</p>

<p>The side-whiskered advertising doctors
are nothing short of criminal when they by
powerful use of words magnify symptoms
and feelings to be grave, serious fore-runners
of awful disease, and by fright,
bring in the hypochondriac to his spider-*web
and filch him in a manner no better
than a thief uses. The thief is really more
honorable, for he steals because he wants
your money and makes no bones about it.</p>

<p>The doctor charlatan steals your money
under the guise of being your benefactor.</p>

<p>As I have explained in "Pep," illness,
feeling out of sorts, local pains and sickness,
unless of the contagious or infectious kind,
are largely conditions of the mind and of
food habits, and surely are accentuated by
fear thought.</p>

<p>Because people have off days, and aches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and pains, the frock-coated, white lawn tie
doctors and pseudo professors work on
the minds and imaginations, magnify trifles
into troubles, then when the victims lose
courage these charlatans rob them under
the guise of professional advice and treatment.</p>

<p>Most of the temporary ailments are
caused by constipation, wrong diet or lack
of exercise. The doctor gives a laxative,
nature re-asserts herself, and the patient is
cured.</p>

<p>Chronic ailments require long treatments,
so as to make long bills and many visits
for the quack doctor.</p>

<p>Read "Pep" and fool the doctors. Your
health and happiness are things largely in
your own control.</p>

<p>When you feel you must have a doctor,
go to your family physician and not to a
strange doctor who advertises. His advertisement
is merely a spiderweb to catch
and hold you while he robs you.</p>

<p>It is a hopeful sign of the brighter future
to which man is progressing, that the
respectable papers will not lend their aid
to swindling doctors. The best papers will
not carry these doctor or fake medicine ads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Before long the government will pass laws
on this baneful, shameful, quack advertising.
Quack doctors, gambling houses, liquor
selling, are all swindling methods to get
money, and in the getting they are killing
men, ruining homes, destroying happiness,
holding back progress.</p>

<p>The one object of the quack doctor is to
size you up and see what you "are good
for." "Good for" means how much money
can he get from you and how long can he
keep you as a patient to contribute to his
coffers.</p>

<p>Let every reader of this book enroll as
an opponent to quack doctors and quack
medicines, and by word and influence help
to hasten the day when such pernicious
swindlers are things of the past. You can't
get health out of a bottle.</p>

<p>And this is true.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHURCH" id="THE_CHURCH"></a>THE CHURCH</h2>

<h3>It Is Hampered By Too Many
Sects</h3>


<p>No two minds can see the same picture,
nor can two persons with logic, on religion,
come to the same definite conclusion.</p>

<p>The old Scripture said, "An eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth." The new
Scripture teaches us to "turn the other
cheek" and "love your enemies."</p>

<p>Two hundred years ago they burned
witches.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago the preacher who took
exception to the universal belief of a hell
of fire and brimstone was thrown out of
the church. Today no preacher believes
in such a hell.</p>

<p>Present day religion is really a Sunday
religion. One and a half hours a week the
members of the church join in singing "we
shall know each other there." The remainder
of the week they make it a point to
keep from knowing each other here.</p>

<p>The protestant church divides itself into
a lot of sects, each one built on some particular
ordinance or practice and each one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
swallows a camel and strains at a gnat.
One sect insists that baptism shall be by
immersion because the disciples baptized
that way. They believe in following customs
literally, yet in the cities they immerse
the members in a big tub under the pulpit,
which practice is entirely different from the
method employed by John the Baptist.</p>

<p>One sect insists upon having a communion
every Sunday because the Bible
says, "as often as you do this," etc. To be
literal in the matter of communion, the
Lord's Supper should be served at night
as the original was, and it should be supper
and not a few pieces of broken crackers.</p>

<p>The sect that insists on following the
Scriptures in the matter of baptism by
immersion fails to follow the Scriptures in
the matter of washing the feet or anointing
the head.</p>

<p>Many years ago the church considered it
a sacrilege to use an organ. Today they
have orchestras and hire operatic singers.</p>

<p>So it seems that the church is broadening
out. Thinking men believe that religion
should not be an auto-intoxication of self-condemnation
or worry, sobs and misery.
Because so much of this sort of teaching is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
prevalent the church is not making the
gains it should. The church is largely supported
by nice little women, many of them
maiden ladies who have little to do, and
know little of the great problems of the
busy world.</p>

<p>I am thoroughly convinced that the
church must recognize that evolution is
taking place, that we are to be more charitable,
more broad in our views, less technical
in our tenets and more practical in our work.</p>

<p>We will have to cut down the fences
between the sects and all get together in
the great field for a common cause rather
than trying to maintain little independent
vineyards.</p>

<p>Religion must teach smiles and joy,
courage and brotherly love, instead of
frowns, dejection, fear and envy.</p>

<p>It must teach how to be and how to get
good out of our today on earth. If we are
good and do good here, we certainly will
help our future prospects.</p>

<p>Certainly we are progressing from narrowness,
bigotry, selfishness and envy, to
broadness, reason, brotherly love and contentment,
and we shall progress from the
narrow confines of obstinate orthodoxy or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
bulldogmatics, by breaking down the sect,
cult, ism, and doxy barriers until we all
join in a universal church in which all can
put their hearts and beliefs, in which all
can find full range for their spiritual belief
and expression.</p>

<p>That big, broad, right church will be in
harmony with God's purpose.</p>

<p>The Creator made all men and He doesn't
confine His love or His interest to any one
little man-made narrow sect, or creed.</p>

<p>"God is love." "Love thy neighbor."
"Help the weak, cheer the grief stricken."
Those are the commands and purposes we
find everywhere in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>"He that believeth in me shall be saved."
That's a definite promise and it is not
qualified with a lot of creed paragraphs and
beliefs. That promise doesn't have any
buts <ins class="mycorr" title="printed book has 'of'">or</ins> ifs. It doesn't say we shall be
saved whether we are Methodists or Catholics,
or Baptists or Presbyterians. Those
names are man-made, and creeds of those
churches are man-made, too.</p>

<p>At the congress of religions in the World's
Fair at Chicago over three hundred religions
and sects were represented by delegates
from all over the world, and every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
there with hearty accord sang, "Praise God
>From Whom All Blessings Flow" and
"Rock of Ages." Those hymns were universal;
they fitted all creeds and sects.</p>

<p>Big men in the church are intensely
interested in the get-together, universal
church, and each year will mark a definite
progress toward amalgamation of sects and
divisions.</p>

<p>There should be no Methodist Church
North and Methodist Church South.</p>

<p>There should not be churches like the
Congregational and Presbyterian, whose
creeds are identical, the difference being
only in the officers.</p>

<p>The country village of 1,000 population
has five churches; it should have only one.
The country is full of half starved preachers
and weak, struggling congregations.</p>

<p>The get-together movement will help
religion, and it's going to happen surely.</p>

<h2><a name="INVENTORY" id="INVENTORY"></a>INVENTORY</h2>

<h3>A Necessary Practice to Bring
Efficiency</h3>


<p>Every year the business man goes over
his stock, tools, fixtures, and accounts, and
prepares a statement of assets and liabilities
so as to get a fairly accurate understanding
of his profit and loss.</p>

<p>If he didn't take this inventory his net
worth would be guess work.</p>

<p>This inventory deals with money and
things which are mixed more or less with
the human element and affected more or
less by conditions or trade, crops, competition,
supply and demand.</p>

<p>The business man takes all these conditions
into consideration in preparing for
the coming year. He red flags the mistakes
and green flags the good plans.</p>

<p>The business man should carry the inventory
further. Every month or so he should
take a careful inventory of himself, putting
down his assets of health, initiative, patience,
ability to work, smiles, honesty,
sincerity, and the like. So also he must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
put down in the debit side the pull backs,
hindrances and other business killers in the
list of liabilities. These items are smoothness,
untruth, unfairness, grouchiness, impatience,
worry, ill health, gloom, meanness,
broken word, unfulfilled promises and
the like.</p>

<p>In making up the inventory pay particular
attention to your habits: smoking, drinking,
over-eating, useless display, useless social
functions and other useless things that pull
on your nerves and your pocket book.</p>

<p>Then check up department A, which is
your family. How have you dealt with
your family and children?</p>

<p>Department B is friends; how do you
stand in your treatment of them?</p>

<p>Department C, all other persons. Did
you lie to, cheat, steal from or defraud any
one? How much cash profit did you make?
How much less a man did the act make you?</p>

<p>Go over your self-respect account. Does
it show profit or loss.</p>

<p>Check up your employees' account. What
has your stewardship shown? Have you
drawn the employees closer, or driven them
further from you?</p>

<p>Analyze your spiritual account. Is your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
religious belief a sham or conviction? Do
you sing on Sunday, "we shall know each
other there," or do you make it a point to
know and love your brother here, seven
days a week.</p>

<p>Be fair in your inventory. Write down
the facts in the two columns "good" and
"bad," then go over the list and put a red
danger flag on the bad. Keep the list until
next inventory and see whether you have
made a gain or loss in your net moral
standing.</p>

<p>Don't read this and say, "a good idea."
Do the thing literally.</p>

<p>Take a clean sheet of paper and write
your personal assets and liabilities down in
the two columns marked "good" and "bad."</p>

<p>If this inventory doesn't help then you
may call me a false prophet.</p>

<p>I know the plan is a good one. I know it
will help you. If it helps you, you will
thank me. There can be no harm in trying,
because it's a worth-while thing to test.</p>

<p>The business man who never takes inventory
is likely to go bump some day.</p>

<h2><a name="EGOTISM" id="EGOTISM"></a>EGOTISM</h2>

<h3>Those Who Decry It Most Have It
Most</h3>


<p>The ego is in us. It is good to have, but
egotism needs the soft pedal when we speak
or do things.</p>

<p>Many people are unconscious of their
egotism yet they suggest between lines in
their conversation, "even I who am superior
to the herd would do this or that."</p>

<p>For instance, two persons were arguing
about the merits of an inexpensive automobile.
Parenthetically I may say one
belonged to the Ford class and the other
to the can't afford class. A can't afford
snob came to the rescue of the Ford champion
by saying, "that's a good car; why, I
wouldn't mind owning one of them myself,"
and he beamed at the party with the
consciousness of having settled the matter
and removed the stigma from the Ford car.</p>

<p>The egotism crops out often when one
shows a group picture in which he appears.
He doesn't wait for you to find him; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
pokes his arm over your shoulder and says,
"that's me."</p>

<p>To each of us in the manner of things
the I is the center of our world. We see
things always through our I's.</p>

<p>If we wish to get along without friction
we must remember that the other fellow
has his I's also, and when we try to make
him see things through our I's it makes
trouble.</p>

<p>The hall mark of education, refinement
and character in the broad sense is the
ability to exclude the personal so far as
possible from our conversation. And be big
enough to grant to others their undoubted
right to see and think from their own
standpoint.</p>

<p>Argument develops egotism more than
most any other thing will.</p>

<p>How often have you convinced another
in an argument?</p>

<p>How often have you been convinced in
an argument?</p>

<p>The world is big, there are millions of
others in it and our job is a big one if we
'tend pretty well to our own knittin'.</p>

<h2><a name="PERSEVERANCE" id="PERSEVERANCE"></a>PERSEVERANCE</h2>

<h3>It Is the Last Step in the Race
That Counts</h3>


<p>Four hundred and twenty-three years
ago Christopher Columbus landed on an
island which he thought was India.</p>

<p>Chris was mighty happy as he put his
foot on good old mother earth; not so much
because he had discovered a new way to
India, as he thought, but because his foot
touched land.</p>

<p>Two days before he landed on San Salvador
his crew pitched into him and threatened
to throw him in the sea and turn about
the ship to Spain.</p>

<p>If Chris had shown the white feather,
1492 would not be the date of the first line
in the geography, announcing the "Discovery
of America."</p>

<p>Chris had perseverance, the stuff that
makes men successful.</p>

<p>He started to find India by sailing westward.
He didn't succeed in his purpose,
but his determination was rewarded just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the same, for he found a new country, and
that was worth while.</p>

<p>Before he started he was promised ten
per cent of the revenue from any lands he
might discover. Just imagine what that
would mean today.</p>

<p>Columbus had perseverance and pep, and
his unwavering fidelity to his cause brought
him success in his efforts.</p>

<p>The world has improved since 1492, but
the percentage of men who would keep on
like Columbus did has not increased,
perhaps.</p>

<p>Columbus sailed with three ships, the
largest sixty-six feet long. He steered to
the direction of the setting sun. His crew
was 120 men. None of them were enthusiastic
at the start; all of them disgusted,
discouraged and ready to mutiny at the
last.</p>

<p>But Christopher kept the ships pointed
West, through rain, shine, through drifting
breezeless days and through storms. He
kept on, and on and on, and he brought
home the bacon, which being interpreted
means success crowned his efforts.</p>

<p>Perseverance and pep produce prosperity,
peace and plenty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the mileage made on October 12th,
1492, that counted.</p>

<p>It is the last step in a race that counts.</p>

<p>It is the last stroke on the nail that
counts.</p>

<p>The moral is that many a prize has been
lost just when it was ready to be plucked.</p>

<p>Perseverance&mdash;patience&mdash;pluck&mdash;pep&mdash;are
particularly profitable if pursued until

<h2><a name="GEOLOGY" id="GEOLOGY"></a>GEOLOGY</h2>

<h3>The Earth's Incontestable Pages of
Truth</h3>


<p>On the wall in the room where I write
these lines is a fossil herring which the
boys dug up in the Rockies near Frozen Dog,
at an altitude of six thousand feet.</p>

<p>The herring is a salt water fish proving
that the country around Frozen Dog was
at one time under the sea.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, in the Missouri River
bottom near Omaha, some Harvard scientists
discovered the remains of three ancient
towns, one buried on top of the other.</p>

<p>In the Nile valley in Egypt nine towns,
in one location, have been unearthed, each
town in a different strata of alluvial deposit.</p>

<p>The ninth or top city is the ancient City
of Memphis, once the largest city in the
world.</p>

<p>Those cities and the mute eloquence of
my fossil herring plainly point out the fact
that the world is millions of years old.</p>

<p>Last summer I found some coral on
Washington Island, which is off the point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of land where Lake Michigan and Green
Bay meet. Coral is only formed in salt
water.</p>

<p>Geologists tell me that Washington Island
and surrounding country plainly shows
marks of three distinct glacial periods.</p>

<p>Several times the poles were in the
tropical climate, and consequently the tropics
or the temperate zones at least were
under permanent snow and ice.</p>

<p>The earth changes its axis every few
thousand centuries, that we know.</p>

<p>The rains and snows wash the earth to
the sea, depositing layers of sand and
sediment, which as the ages go by, turn to
stone and form permanent pages that man
may read in succeeding eras.</p>

<p>During the world's changes, vast surfaces
of earth and rock are lifted to mountain
heights and other places lowered and the
sea covers them.</p>

<p>Thus the habitations of man have been
buried, new earth covered them, new towns
were built and again the covering process.</p>

<p>Scientists are deciphering the story of
the earth and its people. Babylonia and
Egypt left records which our learned men
can read, but ages and eons before these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
ancients there were races who could not
write even crude picture or hieroglyphic
languages, and probably we shall never
know much about these very old times.</p>

<p>Around our Mississippi Valley we know
of Mound Builders before our Indians. In
the Southwest the relics of the cliff dwellers
are abundant.</p>

<p>This summer at Salt Lake City I saw
seven mummies of fair-haired people that
were discovered in Southern Utah.</p>

<p>Near Naples, in digging a well, the workmen
found statuary, jewelry and cooking
utensils. The Italian government began
excavating and they opened up to modern
gaze an old city. The town was Pompeii.</p>

<p>People may now walk the streets of old
Pompeii as freely as the streets of Kansas
City, and the old pavements are likewise
worn and torn like the present streets of
Kansas City.</p>

<p>The residents of Pompeii had fine plumbing,
baths and luxuries.</p>

<p>They had a place called a vomitorium.
The old Roman sports were gluttons; they
stuffed themselves, then went to the vomitorium
and threw up so they could eat more.</p>

<p>Near Pompeii is the ancient buried city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of Herculaneum, but it is covered with
lava, hard as granite, while Pompeii is
covered with ashes.</p>

<p>Our western hemisphere is called the new
world, but all parts of the world are equally
old.</p>

<p>The Missouri River swelled up and
washed out a big cul de sac and bared those
three towns near Omaha. We haven't dug
much in America but likely in a few years
we will discover some old towns equally as
ancient as Pompeii.</p>

<p>Verily, this earth of ours has had humans
on it for more than the 6,000 years our
written records give as its age.</p>

<h2><a name="PATRIOTISM" id="PATRIOTISM"></a>PATRIOTISM</h2>

<h3>An Intoxicant That Often Turns
Men Into Murderers</h3>


<p>A false patriotism, an inherited acceptance
of servility and obedience, makes the
foreigners meek, sheep-like men.</p>

<p>This great war, and most every great
war of the past, is possible because of a
distorted understanding of patriotism.</p>

<p>Patriotism began away back yonder when
sons and daughters were taught love and
loyalty to the pater, the father. The
patriarchs of old extended the patriot idea
to the tribe and later as tribes banded
together and formed nations. The patriotism
principle was the basis for the bond
that tied men together for a common cause.</p>

<p>Now patriotism is bounded by geographical
lines and national boundary lines. The
patriotism is most sincere, and most solemn,
for men willingly sacrifice their lives for it.</p>

<p>But, really, this patriotism is one of the
narrowest and most cruel forces in the
world. It causes wars, waste and desolation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
It makes jealousies, braggadocio and keeps
up the fight spirit.</p>

<p>The false patriotism is an obstacle to
broader human progress, brotherly love
and the finer things in life.</p>

<p>Kings and rulers, fired by selfish egotism,
know full well what a powerful force
patriotism is and they nurse the babes with
fatherland stuff and give them tin soldiers
to play with and tin helmets to wear.</p>

<p>Patriotism, when it reflects love of the
place of one's nativity, when it spells home
and love and association, is a natural and a
beautiful sentiment.</p>

<p>But patriotism, as fomented and fostered
by governments for war spurs and goads,
is a monster that lives on blood.</p>

<p>To keep this false patriotism alive, wars
must be made, so that human blood can be
secured to save the monster from perishing.
Human blood fires and intoxicates this
false patriotism behemoth.</p>

<p>And so, on slight pretexts Kings are
insulted. War lords have put out chips on
their shoulders on purpose to be knocked
off, and when the chip is brushed off then
comes the declaration of war.</p>

<p>The banner, patriotism, is flaunted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the air. It is the shibboleth of the red
blooded, hot headed, bravest and best of
the nation, the youth, who die in countless
thousands&mdash;for what?</p>

<p>Such patriotism is failure and worse than
failure. It is hindrance to civilization.</p>

<p>These bewildered men have let reason
escape, and intoxicated false patriotism
poison come in their brains to take the place
of reason.</p>

<p>In their delirium they try to appear consistent,
logical and abused. In their extremity
they try to co-ordinate their acts
with God's mind.</p>

<p>Each nation has its own interpretation of
the Divine will. Each asks Divine help
for his nation.</p>

<p>God looks at the maddened millions of
insane murderers and his heart is torn as
He sees the avalanche of tears shed by
bereaved wives and children.</p>

<p>The patriotism that is responsible for
starting this war is a mockery, a snare, a
delusion, and deserves the profoundest contempt
of every man who loves his fellow man.</p>

<p>Europe has certainly put riot in patriotism.</p>

<h2><a name="RIDICULE" id="RIDICULE"></a>RIDICULE</h2>

<h3>A Poor Vehicle for Humor</h3>


<p>The man who ridicules everything is on
the toboggan slide and he will finish the
slide as an out-and-out grouch.</p>

<p>You and I know men who never have a
pleasant word to say of anyone, or a serious
commendation of anything.</p>

<p>Ridicule and sarcasm are often coated
with would-be humor, and try to pass for
puns. By and by, however, this ridicule
and sarcasm gets to be a habit, and the
coat of humor becomes threadbare.</p>

<p>Just at this time friends depart, for the
grouch phase of the disease has started.</p>

<p>Sarcasm and ridicule are powerful
weapons when used adroitly and for good
purposes. But when sarcasm and ridicule
are used constantly as a means to generate
fun or as vehicles for humor, then the evil
commences.</p>

<p>People will listen to you for awhile, if
you good-naturedly ridicule a thing, but
when you are known to have the habit,
then is when friends give you the go-by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarcasm and ridicule wound deeply; they
are hot pokers jabbed in quivering flesh.</p>

<p>Don't juggle with ridicule or sarcasm, for
people look beneath the veneer nowadays.
They remember and repeat the axiom,
"there's many a true word spoken in jest."</p>

<p>There are so many beautiful things to
say, so many kind expressions to utter, so
many helpful hints to give, that we should
be ashamed to say or do things even jokingly
that may hurt another.</p>

<p>Safest way is to run no chances. When
you ridicule a thing or a person, you may
ridicule the tender heart of one you should
cheer and help.</p>

<p>Ridicule is the negative element anyway;
the only good it can be is by reflex or
rebound force.</p>

<p>Ridicule is conceived by the humor idea.
It is used because it so easily lends itself
to a seeming clever way to create a laugh.</p>

<p>Humor of the clean sort is a rare gift.
Humor may easily descend to low comedy
by use of ridicule, and often the audience
does not differentiate between low comedy
and rare humor.</p>

<p>The masses will laugh when the comedian
on the stage hits his friend with a club;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
that sort of fun-making satisfies adults who
have children's brains and such brain-constructed
people will also laugh at jokes
which ride on ridicule. But you who read
these lines are worthy of better things;
that's why you are reading this book. If,
in my audience there are those who have
the ridicule habit, I want to arouse you to
a better sense of humor than you can get
by the employment of ridicule and sarcasm.</p>

<p>I don't want you to descend to the level
of the grouch. The slide-down is so easy,
the climbing back and up from the depth
is so very hard.</p>

<p>Ridicule and sarcasm are cheap, slap-*stick
methods to produce fun. They leave
a sting many times when you are not
aware of it.</p>

<p>When fighting whiskey, sin, corruption
or evil hosts, then use burning ridicule and
caustic sarcasm to sizzle and destroy the
things that need to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Now I've told you, and next time you
find yourself using ridicule or sarcasm to
provoke mirth remember you are toying
with a habit-forming practice that is likely
to get the best of you unless you stop and
stop now.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WIFE" id="THE_WIFE"></a>THE WIFE</h2>

<h3>She Is Your Partner, Don't Cheat
Her</h3>


<p>A wife is either a partner or an employee.
If a partner, she has a right to the fifty-fifty
split on profits; if an employee she is
entitled to her wages.</p>

<p>A thrifty husband is commendable, but
a show-me-what-you-did-with-that-money
husband should be punished by being sentenced
to attend pink teas, afternoon receptions,
and to match samples at the dry
goods store.</p>

<p>Married folks must be on the partnership
basis, or there's sand in the gear box.</p>

<p>Give the wife the check-book; let her pay
the bills; tote fair with her; show her and
give her just what your income affords, and
what economic and wise administration
warrants; she'll cut the cloth to fit the
garment.</p>

<p>When the husband questions every turn,
every move, every cent, the wife feels like
a prisoner or a slave. Wives will do good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
team work when they are broken to double
harness with their husbands.</p>

<p>Women are generally raised without any
requirements of economy; they are pretty
birds, and used to preening and smoothing
their plumage and looking pretty.</p>

<p>It's the female instinct in the human. In
the animal world the male has the plumage
and does the strutting and fascinating act;
but in the human animal the female is the
bird with the bright plumage.</p>

<p>You can't expect her to know about
pennies and purses and prudent purchases
the moment you slip the ring on her finger.</p>

<p>But she's an intelligent filly and she'll go
in double harness much better if trained
and coaxed and petted than she will if she
is haltered, broke and a Spanish bit put in
her mouth by the husband's stinginess.</p>

<p>She'll shop better than her husband if
he takes an interest in her shopping and
encourages her in her economical administration
of the household budget.</p>

<p>She wants a word of appreciation once
in a while. She chills under the surveillance
and parsimony of an eagle-eyed, detective,
lawyer-like husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>She's a sweet bird and sweet birds and
hawks don't nest well together.</p>

<p>Where the hawk and the dove are in the
same cage the feathers will fly.</p>

<p>As I came through the park this morning
I saw a pair of robins who have the right
idea. They share home responsibilities and
do fine team work. I think they are mighty
happy, too; daddy red breast looked mighty
proud as he hustled worms for the family
breakfast.</p>

<p>Mamma robin looked down with loving
eyes at her hubby, and the little baby robins
sang a chorus of joy at the very privilege of
living in such a home.</p>

<p>Worry will fly out of the window the
moment the husband and wife lay their
cards on the table and play the open hand.
The moment one or the other keeps a few
cards in the sleeve, then worry and trouble
comes back.</p>

<p>The moral of this is: husbands and wives,
live together, get together, stay together,
play together, save together, grow together,
share together. Travel the same road;
don't take different paths.</p>

<h2><a name="MENTAL_PLEASURES" id="MENTAL_PLEASURES"></a>MENTAL PLEASURES</h2>

<h3>The Rarest, Sweetest Pleasures in
the World</h3>


<p>There are two principal pleasures man
seeks; one is material pleasures and that
takes in about ninety-nine per cent of the
human family.</p>

<p>The other, the one per cent, seeks mental
pleasures, and this little group is the one
that gets the real, lasting, satisfying and
improving pleasures.</p>

<p>Material pleasures are eating, displaying,
possessing, and society. Material pleasures
generate in the human the desire for fluff,
feathers, and four-flushing.</p>

<p>Material pleasures accentuate the desire
to possess things, and in the strife for
possession hearts are broken, fortunes
wasted, nerves shattered and finer sentiments
calloused.</p>

<p>The homes where material pleasures
abound are the ones where worry, neurasthenia
and nervous prostration abound.</p>

<p>Material pleasures are merely stimulants
for the time being, and there always comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the intermittent reflexes of gloom and
depression.</p>

<p>The desire to show off, to excite envy in
others, is always present at the homes where
material pleasures are the rule.</p>

<p>Material pleasures call for crowds.
Mental pleasures are best enjoyed in solitude.</p>

<p>The material pleasure seeker lives a life
of convention, engagements, routine, action,
strain and high tension.</p>

<p>The person who is so fortunate as to
appreciate and follow mental pleasures, is
serene, natural, happy and content.</p>

<p>A cozy room, loved ones around, music,
books, love and social conversation, those
are mental pleasures; those are best.</p>

<p>He who can pick up a book, and read
things worth while, gets satisfaction unknown
to those whose life is banquets,
theaters, dances, automobiles, parties,
bridge, clubs and society doings.</p>

<p>The lover of books and home can enjoy
the play, because he only goes to plays
worth while, and he doesn't overdo it.</p>

<p>The confirmed theater-goer is a pessimist;
he roasts nearly every play, and he is
universally bored.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Get the home reading habit. Don't over-*do
it. Call on friends, go to a good picture
show once in a while; to good concerts; to
good plays, but do not make this going out
in the evening plan a habit. Let it be
merely a dessert, or a rarity; like candy and
ice cream, proper and enjoyable when
taken in moderation.</p>

<p>When you get started reading worth-*while
books on science, on history, on
geography, on travel, on natural history,
you will get into an inexhaustible field of
pleasure and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Any time you can pick up your book and
be happy.</p>

<p>Waits in railway stations will be opportunities;
trips on trains will be pleasant;
evenings alone will be enjoyable, if you
can get into a book you like.</p>

<p>Mental pleasures are best.</p>

<p>Material pleasures are merely passing
pleasures.</p>

<h2><a name="PANAMA" id="PANAMA"></a>PANAMA</h2>

<h3>The Man Who Found It and the
Man Who Used It</h3>


<p>Four hundred years ago Jim Balboa
climbed a mountain peak on the Isthmus
of Panama, and looked on the boundless
Pacific and said: "I have this day discovered
you, and henceforth the geographies
will perpetuate this great event."</p>

<p>Little did Jim think that by 1914 ships
of twenty thousand tons would sail through
the impassable mountains.</p>

<p>Jim knew he had discovered something
great, but little did he dream of the real
greatness of the world's future. Little did
he dream that the vast new continent on
whose neck he stood was to hold the greatest
nation of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Gold, new territory for kings, new fields
for the church&mdash;were the magnets which
drew early navigators like Balboa to the
land in the West across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Those early adventurers little thought of
exploiting their discoveries for the benefit
of mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a long time and a far cry from Capt.
Balboa to Colonel Goethals, from the discoverer
to the constructor, and it is our
good fortune to see and enjoy a work
beyond the wildest dreams of Columbus,
Balboa, Cortez and the other wanderlust
adventurers.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the Panama Canal,
now opened to the world, was for years
deemed a chimerical dream and an impossibility,
by the world as well as by most
Americans.</p>

<p>Every ditch digger, including the great
De Lesseps, proved a failure, so to Yankee
grit in the person of Goethals belongs the
credit for the completed work which is now
called the "Eighth Wonder of the World."</p>

<p>The Pyramids, the hanging gardens of
Babylon, are wonders, but we have a
Yankee contractor who can duplicate them
if anyone puts up the money for the job.</p>

<p>We do not build pyramids or hanging
gardens because they serve no useful purpose.</p>

<p>The Panama Canal is a greater wonder
and is a most practical benefit to mankind.
It doubles our navy; it enables us to move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
supplies of every kind from one coast to
the other quickly and less expensively.</p>

<p>It shortens the world's highway between
the oceans and helps every human being.</p>

<p>Balboa's name will live in geographies as
the discoverer of the Pacific Ocean, but
Goethals' name will be remembered as the
man who made most use of that discovery
for the benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>The shades of Balboa and De Lesseps
likely stalk around Panama at midnight
and rub their eyes in amazement.</p>

<h3>The One Time in Our Keeping</h3>


<p>As I walk on the old Santa Fe Trail each
morning through Penn Valley Park in
Kansas City, the marks of time are plainly
visible.</p>

<p>Erosion of water and wind have bared
the sedimentary rocks and exposed the
layers in well defined pages so I may study
this great rock-paged geology book, and
indeed it's a pleasure to me.</p>

<p>Back of all is the grand plan of the
Universe of which this earth is an atom.
That plan is ruled by a Divine law and
power.</p>

<p>For you or me to take a fragment of
truth and attempt to pass it as a definite
science, a complete religion or all truth, is
an assumption which these records of
countless ages frown upon as a hopeless,
bootless task.</p>

<p>All science has some truth; all creeds,
sects, isms and cults likewise have truth,
but no branch or group possesses all truth.</p>

<p>My fossil fish on the wall wiggled his tail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
thousands of years ago, very likely millions
of years.</p>

<p>He lived and died in accordance with the
plan of the Creator of the Universe and
you are an atom and I am an atom in that
Universe and governed by the power that
gave life and crushed to death that fossil
fish.</p>

<p>Verily we presume when we say, "we
have all the truth; think as we do or you
are lost."</p>

<p>The old world has not told its full story.
The Universe of which this world is a part
is still a deeper mystery.</p>

<p>We shall not know all truth until the
great revealing time.</p>

<p>We cannot change the pages of the
millions of years gone by. We can do very
little to change the pages of the millions of
years to come. What little we can do, we
can only do TODAY.</p>

<p>Today is yours and mine; let's do the
best we can with our possession in act and
thought and word.</p>

<p>The sun goes down behind the sky-line
on the West as it has done for millions of
years. I lay aside my pen with a bigger
view, a deeper appreciation of the Creator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and a profounder faith in His wisdom and
works than ever.</p>

<p>God made. God rules. God plans. And
verily we are weaklings and foolish, who
presume by selfish prayer to suggest to Him
what He shall do.</p>

<p>Let us strive to be appreciative of Him
and try to lift ourselves in sublime thought
into the higher faith thought and realize
that we are part of Him and His plan, and
failure is impossible to us, if we keep up
and on, doing good, speaking softly, dealing
gently, showing kindness today and
living in accordance with the big, broad,
generous, charitable plan instead of the
little, bigoted, narrow, selfish idea that we
are sole possessors of truth and that the
man who differs with us in belief is in error.</p>

<p>This chapter is about big things and in it
is a big moral for all who are big enough to

and they have accepted your sacrifices,
work, and watchfulness as matter of fact.</p>

<p>You've had dreams of a some day when
you would relax and play and enjoy, but
you have set that some day too far ahead.
You consider yourself after all your loved
ones are more comfortable and happy, and
time is passing, Dad; the marks of time are
showing on your poor, tired head; the
wrinkles of care are marking your face, and
the roses are bleaching from your cheeks.</p>

<p>You are too unselfish, too much centered
in that some day. Let's change things a
bit, Dad. Sometimes the some day doesn't
come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>You are entitled to, and it's your duty
to have, happiness and pleasures and health
and joys, right here now today.</p>

<p>Your loved ones do not want you to
spend your health getting wealth. They
don't want to see you worn out, tired,
weary and unhappy in the evening of your
life. Besides it's your duty to let them
share responsibility and work out their
own problems. They will be better if you
let them gain knowledge by practical experience.</p>

<p>Come on, Dad; get in the group and
enjoy things now and you will live longer and
you will get more out of life and give more
pleasure to your loved ones. Get in the
game, Dad; let's see the old light and
twinkle in your eyes; let's have the sunshine
on your face; the love-light on your
lips and the happiness in your heart. Come
on, Dad, we all want you to do these things.</p>

<p>Leave your cares at the office; come on
and play, and you will be so much better
and stronger and so much more successful
in your business.</p>

<p>Let's have the corners of your mouth
turned up tonight at the supper table; be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>

<p>We don't want to hear any more sh&mdash;sh&mdash;
or whispers when you come home.
We don't want to feel that restraint and
uncomfortable feeling; let's laugh and sing
and love and play&mdash;let's make your home-*coming
a joyous event.</p>

<p>We all love you, Dad, but you haven't
made it as comfortable as you might for us
when we try to express our love. You've
been too tired, too busy, too much occupied
with those business thoughts.</p>

<p>Don't you see how we love you, and how
we appreciate you? Don't you know that
there is no one in the world who can take

that if we soothe or coddle our babies they
will get the habit and require our attention
always before they go to sleep.</p>

<p>Old Mother Nature has been pretty successful
in raising animals. Let the kitten,
dog, pig or chicken give the sign of pain or
distress and the mother will hasten to its
offspring and nestle it.</p>

<p>When a baby cries, it's because it's
hungry, or too warm or too hot or too
uncomfortable, or it has pain or distress.
It's just nature's instinct given by God to
the helpless infant that it may call attention
to its trouble. The doctor would complain
if uncomfortable. The doctor or the
parent can help himself, but the baby can
use its only signal, a cry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>When baby cries it should be taken up
and soothed. Don't pay any attention to
the doctor who says the baby cries to be
petted; baby can't reason in its infant
days; its little brain hasn't reached the
reasoning powers.</p>

<p>Doctors constantly protest and warn us
against over exertion on the part of children
and even adults; yet they tell us to let the
few-weeks-old baby cry, which is the most
violent and extreme exertion it can put
forth.</p>

<p>Crying puts a strain on all the baby's
vital organs and its delicate, fragile blood
vessels and heart. There have been thousands
of babies who have had irreparable
damage done to their constitutions because
of this cold-blooded, heartless fad of the
doctors, to let baby cry.</p>

<p>Many a mother's heart is torn and
wrung because of the doctor's order, "Let
the baby cry."</p>

<p>The mother is worked up into an excited
nervous condition by the doctor's inhuman
order to let the baby cry, and this same
doctor tells her not to become excited
because it will have a bad effect on her
nursing baby. Just read this paragraph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
over again and see if the doctor hasn't
crossed his logic wires and insulted common
sense.</p>

<p>The doctors become calloused; they are
used to seeing pain and suffering. It's easy
for them to endure pain in others, and easy
for them to give them heartless orders.</p>

<p>And generally the doctor who affects
most knowledge about baby rearing is the
one who has no babies of his own.</p>

<p>Dr. Walls of Chicago is one of the most
eminent child specialists in the world and
he agrees with my conclusions in this matter
and so does most every really great child
specialist I know.</p>

<p>When baby cries, find the reason; change
its position; see if there is a pin sticking;
find out whether it's heat, cold, hunger or
pain.</p>

<p>There's a reason why babies cry. My
wife is emphatic on that point and she has
reared three mighty fine babies, and I have
watched and helped her.</p>

<h2><a name="GIRL" id="GIRL"></a>GIRL</h2>

<h3>Be a Know Girl, Not a Show Girl</h3>


<p>Girl, what a wonderful creature you can
be. What a glorious success you can make
of your life, if you get the right start, the
right hands to help you, the right hearts
to love you, and the right eyes to watch
you, the right thoughts to make you, and
the right ideals to guide you.</p>

<p>There are so many influences to spoil
you, so much convention, so much artificiality,
so much snobbery, so much caste,
so much foolish frivolity.</p>

<p>Then there are the wrong examples, the
wrong grooming, the wrong environments,
the wrong influences surrounding you, that
it is not to be wondered why so many girls
lose their heads and make a fizzle of their
young lives.</p>

<p>The fizzle is generally because daddy and
mamma have a lot of foolish notions about
bringing up the girls. Especially is this so
if the parents are wealthy.</p>

<p>Here is the history of many a rich girl.
She is born without welcome, fed on a
bottle, reared by a nurse, grows up in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
nursery, estranged from her mother, later
on sent away to school, mixes with a lot of
other rich girls, gets lots of foolish notions,
false estimates, and prejudiced views. She
graduates and comes home and there are
a lot of "doings" which she attends, then
comes the show-off which is called a debut.</p>

<p>She is shown off like a filly at the horse
show, and some high-collared young man
wins her head although she thinks it's her
heart. She thinks it's the thing to marry,
and he is such "a swell fellow," he is such
"good company," and he "dances so well,"&mdash;these
qualities win her head.</p>

<p>So the girl marries, has children, husband
goes broke and the girl awakens to the
necessity of coming down from her pedestal,
facing stern necessity, and raising her
children as her mother should have raised
her.</p>

<p>That's the picture of the poor rich girl
whose parents are to blame for the nonsense
she got in her head.</p>

<p>But, you, Girl, you are going to learn
your cooking on a gas range instead of a
chafing dish; you'll learn to bake bread
before fudge; you'll learn how to cook solids
before you learn to make salads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>You will study simplicity, sentiment,
sense, sereneness, sweetness, rather than
envy, frills, feathers and foolishness.</p>

<p>God's noblest woman's calling is the
work for children and home.</p>

<p>To cook and sew is a higher duty and
better occupation than bridge parties and
society.</p>

<p>Not that you must cook and sew, my
dear, but that you can if necessary.</p>

<p>With the ability to cook and sew you
can properly direct the cook or seamstress,
and they will respect you for your education.</p>

<p>The painted, powdered, tinsel, fluff,
feathers and furebelow girl may be dashing
now and you may envy her, but you, with
your quiet, sweet, simple, sensible ways&mdash;you
will win real love, real respect, real
affection, real pleasures, real satisfaction, in
all the days to come; you will make a
success of your life.</p>

<p>Frills and feathers may be an attraction
to the girl who makes the fizzle of her life,
but sweetness and simplicity, and sentiment
and sense, are precious jewels that
will endure for all time.</p>

<p>Be that sweet girl. Do not be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
"show" kind, or the blow kind, be the real
"know" kind, and you will grow in the
hearts of all who love reality and hate
artificiality. We all love the "know" kind&mdash;the
sweet, simple, sensible girl who knows.</p>

<p>So here's my hand, little sister, little
daughter, little girl, and to you here are
also the sweetest thoughts of mine heart,
for I picture you through eyes, and through
a heart, that sees two sweet little girls of
my very own.</p>

<p>I am going to stick mighty close to my
girls and try to bring them up to be real
girls who will be loving, lovable and loved.</p>

<p>So then here is the hope that you, girl,
will start right, keep right and end right.
I want you to think of sense, sentiment,
and simplicity rather than dances, dollars,
duds and doings.</p>

<p>I want your life to be one of poise,
happiness and serenity instead of noise,
worry and nerves.</p>

<p>This little message is all for you&mdash;GIRL.</p>

<h2><a name="SPECULATION" id="SPECULATION"></a>SPECULATION</h2>

<h3>You Can't Earn Your Board on the
Board of Trade</h3>


<p>I've been riding through the golden
wheat belt of Kansas, and estimated the
new wealth; for that which grows is the
only real profit or wealth. All else are
trades, speculation or bookkeeping accounts.</p>

<p>The farmer plants the wheat. God makes
it grow and we eat it.</p>

<p>But in a big building in an amphitheater
in the city, is a crowd of wild men in shirt
sleeves, perspiring, shouting, making signs,
clawing the air. This crowd never raised
wheat, but they raise pandemonium. It's
the board of trade; its job is getting the
wheat from the farm to you and me who
require it to live.</p>

<p>I've recently visited the biggest food
market in the world, the Chicago Board of
Trade. Below the gallery sat a nice dignified
elderly man who wrote a note on a slip
of paper, folded it and gave it to a boy.</p>

<p>The boy was off like a shot to the wheat
pit; he gave it to another white-haired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
young-faced man of cultured, refined, even
scholarly bearing, so different from the row
raisers in the pit.</p>

<p>This nice man was the floor man for a
big grain commission house; he read the
message, and then did the Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde act. He turned red, purple, and
green. His neck swelled, he threw back
his head and screamed while he held up
his hand and five fingers. Each finger
meant 5,000 bushels of wheat; five fingers
meant 25,000 bushels to sell. In an instant,
like a pack of wolves, the other crazy men
raised their hands with bent and twisted
fingers, the sign language of the pit.</p>

<p>The old man made a sign, the wheat was
sold. He was Dr. Jekyll again; he yawned
and was composed once more.</p>

<p>Soon a boy came with another slip, and
the old man went mad again. I asked my
host if it wasn't pretty busy today; he
said "no, it's a dull market."</p>

<p>That 25,000 bushels of wheat was sold
half a dozen times. Every broker who
handled it got a commission. The buying
and selling was speculation.</p>

<p>Outside the board were the hangers on,
the down-and-outs, the has-beens, who used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
to be in the pit and throw fits like the nice
old man I've described.</p>

<p>These has-beens have the speculation
bug, and hope they can come back some
day and make fortunes out of lucky guesses.</p>

<p>The only ones who make money on the
board of trade are the company who rents
offices, the cigar man, the lunch man, and
the telegraph operators, and the commission
men who get one-eighth of a cent a bushel
either way the market goes. Some of these
commission men get the speculation bug
and go broke, and yet there are callow
youths and business men and clerks and
other outsiders who believe they are smart
enough to speculate on the Board of Trade.
That belief helps fatten our penitentiaries.</p>

<p>No outsider ever made money on the
Board of Trade if he stayed with the game.
And the speculators on the inside graduate
to the down-and-out class if they play long
enough. There's a group of millionaires
who control them and all others are pikers.</p>

<p>You can't beat the Board of Trade; it's
not in the cards.</p>

<h2><a name="STARS" id="STARS"></a>STARS</h2>

<h3>A Little Study of the Universe</h3>


<p>Tonight I am in the Ozarks and old
Mother Earth is passing through the belt
of meteoric dust, that great mysterious sea
in the universe through which we pass
every year about the middle of November.</p>

<p>It is midnight. I will not reach my
destination until 1:30 in the morning. Two
fellow passengers in the car, after cussing
their luck, have finally gone to Snoozeland,
while I call the passing hours opportunity.</p>

<p>I look out into the night and marvel at
the countless stars in the infinite black
void, and wonder how closely those stars
may be connected with humanity.</p>

<p>That they are connected I have no doubt,
for truly "the sun, the moon, the stars, and
endless space as well, are parts, are things,
like me, that cometh from and runneth by
one grand power of which I am in truth a
part, an atom though I be."</p>

<p>How many stars are there? Well, let's get
ready to appreciate number. I can see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
about 3,000; with opera glasses I could see
30,000.</p>

<p>The late Franklin Adams photographed
the whole canopy with 206 photographs.
He counted the stars by mathematical plans,
and gives the conclusion that there are
1,600,000,000 stars, and that number is
just about the number of humans on this
earth. So then there is one star for each
of us.</p>

<p>Each of those stars, practically speaking,
is larger than the earth. Many have human
beings who think and reason like we do.
Multiply the 1,600,000,000 population on
this earth by any portion of the 1,600,000,000
stars that may have thinking creatures
on them; multiply that total by the millions
of years and millions of generations that
have passed out of existence.</p>

<p>Think of these numbers and limitless
boundaries and then tell me that one little
man, on one little star we call earth, has a
strangle-hold on truth, and that his viewpoint,
his ism, his little dogma, his narrow
creed, is all sufficient, and that he can give
me and you and them definite rules and
patterns for our belief.</p>

<p>Verily, little protoplasm, you have an-*<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
*other guess. We can by experience and
tests prove two and two make four. We
can by practice and experience prove that
love, kindness, help, gentleness, sympathy,
cheer and courage bring happiness.</p>

<p>These are tangible things; but when one
wee Willie with sober face tells you and me
and others that he has the truth about the
definite, full workings of God's plans and
purposes, I think of the greatness of 1,600,000,000
stars each with 1,600,000,000 humans
and of the unnumbered generations
gone by, and say, verily we must live
TODAY and do the best we can today in
act and thought and word.</p>

<p>Yesterday is dead, tomorrow is unknown;
where we have been, where we will be, we
know not. Where we are today we know,
and God in His great plan knows only the
final answer as to our future estate.</p>

<p>He will take us and hold us and place us
in His keeping and according to His purpose,
even though we do not or cannot
follow or believe any one of the little man-formed
creeds, isms or cults as the measure
and rule for our beliefs.</p>

<p>Those stars testify to the certainty of
God, and I believe in Him.</p>

<h2><a name="LEADERS" id="LEADERS"></a>LEADERS</h2>

<h3>Are Ever Subject to Backbiters</h3>


<p>When a man by his brains or by fortunate
combination or circumstances arises to a
position of prominence he becomes a target
for the envious and a pattern for the
imitator.</p>

<p>Emulation and envy are ever alert in
trying to steal the fruits of the leader or
doer of things.</p>

<p>The man who makes a name gets both
reward and punishment. The reward is
his satisfaction in being a producer, a help
to the world, and the glory that comes from
widespread recognition and publicity of his
accomplishment. The punishment is the
slurs, the enmity, the envy and the detraction,
to say nothing of the downright lies
which are told about him.</p>

<p>When a man writes a great book, builds
a great machine, discovers a great truth or
invents a useful article, he becomes a
target for the envious few.</p>

<p>If he does a mediocre thing he is unnoticed;
if his work is a masterpiece,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
jealousy wags its tongue and untruth uses
its sting.</p>

<p>Wagner was jeered. Whistler was called
a mere charlatan. Langley was pronounced
crazy. Fulton and Stephenson were pitied.
Columbus faced mutiny on his ship on the
eve of his discovery of land. Millet starved
in his attic. Time has passed, and the
backbiters are all in unmarked graves.
The world until its end will enjoy Wagner's
music, Whistler and Millet's painting will
attract artists from all over the world, and
inventors will reverence the names of Fulton
and Stephenson.</p>

<p>The leader is assailed because he has
done a thing worth while; the slanderers
are trying to equal his feat, but their imitations
serve to prove his greatness.</p>

<p>Because jealous ones cannot equal the
leader they seek to belittle him.</p>

<p>But the truly worth-while man wins his
laurels and he remains a leader; he had
made his genius and the creature of his
hopes and brains known to the world.</p>

<p>Above the clamor and noise, above the
din of the rocks thrown at him, his masterpiece
and his fame endure.</p>

<p>And compensation, the salve to the sore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
makes the great man deaf to the noise and
immune to the attacks of the knockers.</p>

<p>In his own heart he knows he has done
a thing worth while; his own conscience is
clear, and he cares not for the estimate of
the world.</p>

<p>His own character is his chief concern,
and he is content in the knowledge that
time will bring its reward.</p>

<p>If you have high ideals in business, if
you make success, mark well, you will be
a subject of attacks, of lies, of malice, of
envy, of disreputable competition; there is
no way out of it.</p>

<p>But you will be repaid. The lover of fair
play, the grateful, the true, honest, worth-while
people will flock to your standard;
the riff-raff will skulk behind bushes and
throw rocks and mud, but their acts will
prove to the great mass of the people that
your purposes, practices and policies are
right.</p>

<p>Therefore, courage is to be your chief
asset; with patience, pride, perseverance
your lieutenants.</p>

<p>Be not weary, grow not discouraged when
your progress is hampered by obstacles.</p>

<h2><a name="OLD_AGE" id="OLD_AGE"></a>OLD AGE</h2>

<h3>The Pleasures of a Well Lived Life</h3>


<p>There are three periods in our lives: the
youth period or prospective period, the
adult or introspective period, and the old
age or retrospective period.</p>

<p>Too many there are who look forward to
old age with fear or dread.</p>

<p>But old age has its joys and pleasures as
keen as youth or adult age, if the youth
and adult ages were lived sanely, worthily
and properly.</p>

<p>If middle age is spent in getting dollars
only, then old age will be days of empty
nothingness.</p>

<p>Youth is the planning time of ideals and
ambitions, middle age the building time and
old age the dividend time.</p>

<p>With many, old age is reading the book
of the past, with sadness as the reader
recognizes that the ideals, plans and hopes
were shattered. As age turns the page in
the book of the past he reads one hope after
another vanished in smoke.</p>

<p>Anticipation is seldom realized, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
is as it should be, for in time men will learn
to live each day for each day's good and
each day's happiness.</p>

<p>Let us perform our duty today, let us
put away a kindly act, a smile, a word of
cheer in the bank of good deeds.</p>

<p>Each of us has our share in this world's
work. It matters little whether our actual
share is what we had guessed or wished it
to be.</p>

<p>Vicissitudes clip us here and there, so-called
misfortune or bad luck will strike us
when least suspected. The failure of our
dreams should not grieve us.</p>

<p>We cannot reach up and grasp the stars,
but like the pilot at the wheel at sea we can
steer by those stars and help us on our way.</p>

<p>Our ideal may not be realized but the
journey to it may still be a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Our ideals, plans and hopes had a real
purpose, a real service; they gave us courage
and made us work and thus they were well
worth while.</p>

<p>We must not in the old age period condemn
ourselves because our plans failed or
our castles were shattered.</p>

<p>There is no hard luck but incurable
disease or death. It is not for us to mourn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the past or weep over the vases from which
the flowers are gone.</p>

<p>In our active days we must realize we
are putting memories away in our brains
that will come back to us in old age.</p>

<p>Only what we put in our brains we can
take out.</p>

<p>So then, Mr. Avarice, I warn you if gold
is your God it's cold comfort you will
get in your sunset days.</p>

<p>Build up loving ties, appreciation and
worth-while riches of good deeds, and in
your evening of life you will be welcome in
the midst of the group.</p>

<p>If your life was sold for gold your evening
of life will be short and miserable;
legatees will grudge you your every breath;
they will endure you simply because they
are checking off the days from Time's
calendar until the day of your passing, and
the dollars you sold your soul and heart
and life for will be lavishly spent by cold-blooded
heirs who cared nothing for you.</p>

<p>Leave a legacy of love, example and
character, and if with these there are a few
dollars, they simply prove your frugality,
economy and independence.</p>

<p>A few dollars left to heirs will help.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Many dollars will hurt. Dollars in old age
will give you pleasure by helping in tight
corners, and helping your loved ones over
the bumps in the road.</p>

<p>Use the dollars to help those you love to
help themselves, and your old age will be
a busy, happy one and you won't be in the
way.</p>

<p>To prepare for that happy period of your
life the foundation must be built in the
active today period.</p>

<p>Carry smiles in your old age; they will
keep the heart young, the digestion good,
and life will be worth while.</p>

<h2><a name="TIME" id="TIME"></a>TIME</h2>

<h3>What Geology Tells Us About Time</h3>


<p>I have traveled horseback over the great
arid plains of the West and read the story
of the ages gone before.</p>

<p>In Arizona and New Mexico there are
ancient ruins of forts and cities built by
people we know not of.</p>

<p>Chalcedony Park with its petrified forest
of mammoth trees silently testifies to a
period when vegetation was rampant and on
what is now a desert.</p>

<p>In Wyoming there is coal enough to furnish
fuel for the United States for several
centuries.</p>

<p>Coal is carbon made from trees and
vegetation covered with earth and rock,
pressed, and preserved through the thousands
of years necessary to change it from vegetable
to carbon.</p>

<p>Oceans and floods gradually covered
millions of acres of trees and plants with
ooze and soil and sand. Ages turned some
of these deposits to stone.</p>

<p>There in bleak Wyoming is testimony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and evidence of changes that time only can
bring about.</p>

<p>"A thousand years is as a day and a day
is as a thousand years." Thus wrote the
scribe of old. So then we must consider
this estimate of time in reading the history
of the sequential events in the first chapter
of Genesis which describes the order of the
world's creation.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the formation of the
world was the dividing the light from the
darkness, conforming to the rotation of our
globe and consequent day and night.</p>

<p>Then the separating of land and water,
then the birth of vegetation on the land,
the creation of fish and reptiles in the sea,
the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field
and finally the higher animal, man.</p>

<p>And the pages of the earth's surface
carry in their stratification indelible records
harmonizing with this scriptural arrangement
of the evolution of the earth from its
chaotic misty past to its concrete definite
present.</p>

<p>Yes, this earth of ours is old, so old
mere man cannot contemplate or accurately
estimate its wondrous age.</p>

<p>The fossils of the mammoth reptiles and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
beasts which lived before the ken of man
are numerous in the fascinating West I
know so well.</p>

<p>In those arid desert hills are bones of the
ancient rhinoceros, parent of our horse, and
there are shells and fossils of fish and bones
of animals imbedded in the strata of rock.</p>

<p>Man reads these pages and he is lost in
bewilderment, impoverished in thought,
dumb for words, paralyzed for expressions,
to co-ordinate the evidence with any man
measure of what the age of the earth is.</p>

<p>Historians say the world was 4,004 years
old before the Christian era and 1915
years have passed since then, making the
age to date 5,919 years.</p>

<p>The first records speak of Adam and Eve
and Cain and Abel and up to the time Cain
went to the land of Nod there is no record
of any other people in the world.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that through the dark
ages dates and facts were lost and even
there may have been mistakes in translations.</p>

<p>We have not a complete history in
written language, but we have some very
<ins class="mycorr" title="Printed book has 'pefinite'">definite</ins> history in the rocks and hills and
lands and seas<ins class="mycorr" title="Printed book is missing '.'">.</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>There must have been people in the
world when Cain went to the land of Nod,
for the Bible history says Cain took unto
himself a wife and his wife bore him a son
and she named the son Enoch, and she
builded a city for her first born and the
name of the city was called Enoch.</p>

<p>The world certainly is more than 5,919
years old. Read the record of time so
plainly visible at Niagara Falls.</p>

<p>Niagara Falls eats away about two feet
of rock in a century; the gorge is a good
many miles long. At the present rate of
erosion it takes 2,640 years to eat away a
mile. Multiply that by the distance between
the falls and Lake Ontario and you
have an idea of how many years Niagara
Falls has been at work.</p>

<p>Before Niagara Falls was in existence
the country round about was under the
sea; before that under glaciers; before that
under the tropics, and I don't know how
many times it has swung on its pendulum
between Frigid, Temperate and Tropic Zones.</p>

<p>So you see we are getting lost in a
labyrinth of mystery when we take these
known facts concerning the earth's age and
try to definitely set any particular number
of millions of years as the old world's age.</p>

<p>And now my pleasant occupation of
writing this book draws to an end. I
sincerely hope you have received some
definite suggestions that will be helpful to
you; that's my first purpose.</p>

<p>I have more books in my brain in embryo.
They are hatching out and you may look
for books of mine to appear every once in
awhile so long as ability to write is mine.</p>

<p>There is an indescribable something in
my relation with my readers that is sweet
beyond words to tell. I look upon you, the
readers, as brothers and sisters; yes, more
than that, you are my friends.</p>

<p>As I travel both in this country and
abroad I drop in book stores and meet the
friends who sell my books and from them
I hear some mighty pleasant and enthusiastic
expressions of approval. Appreciation
is worth more than dollars.</p>

<p>The daily increasing sales of my books is
due to one thing, and that is that you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
my readers, my friends, are telling your
friends to buy my books. This personal
interest and recommendation is advertising
of the most valuable kind.</p>

<p>Because you get your friends to buy, the
sales are good and that's encouragement.
It's the spur that keeps me ever writing,
planning, and studying, that I may write
more books.</p>

<p>So here is my hand of friendship, my
heart's gratitude, my complete appreciation
of your interest and patronage.</p>

<p>We've spent many pleasant moments
together in these evening round-ups, and
until we meet again in person or through
one of my books, keep good thoughts working
for your benefit. Get serenity, poise,
power, purpose and good cheer.</p>

<p>You can be strong; you will be strong so
long as you control your thought habits.</p>

<p>Life is beautiful, it's well worth while.
Clouds will come, obstacles will confront
you, troubles will get in your way; but each
and all of these will disappear, if you keep
on your way, with courage, smiles, will
power, and perseverance.</p>

<p>And from me and my loved ones to you
and your loved ones here are all good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
wishes, and encouragement, and sympathy,
and love, all tied together with this golden
thought: let us help one another while we
sojourn here today, and as we do it&mdash;let us</p>

<p>Brass Tacks is a unique publication, so-called because
Col. Hunter gets right down to "brass tacks" in advancing
pointed optimisms, level-headed truths, driven-home
common sense. It is a book of vital paragraphs and concrete
ideas dealing with the life issues of every day. A
suggestive, terse guide to right thinking along the highway
of humor and hopefulness.</p>

<p>There are sentences to remember for their keen analysis,
their brevity, their wit. You will like "Brass Tacks" if you
like to get somewhere and get there quickly. There is entertainment
and inspiration. It is the kind of book you re-read&mdash;and
find new meanings and help each time.</p>

purpose.</p>
